Finally, each time an add of any type dies, it will drop 4 <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=308377/void-infused-ichor">Void Infused Ichor</a> for players to pick up. You should have your DPS primarily get these to damage the boss, and grab them as a healer whenever you believe one of them is going to expire.</p><h1>Suggested Talents</h1><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/77/Standard-Talents.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/77/responsive/Standard-Talents-xs.jpg 300w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/77/responsive/Standard-Talents-sm.jpg 480w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/77/responsive/Standard-Talents-md.jpg 768w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/77/responsive/Standard-Talents-lg.jpg 1024w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/77/responsive/Standard-Talents-xl.jpg 1360w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/77/responsive/Standard-Talents-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="620" height="383"></p><p>A standard talent setup works fine on this boss. <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=192077/wind-rush-totem">Wind Rush Totem</a> may be nice for your group at some points as there will be a good amount of movement around the room, especially for the melee group moving from add set to add set.</p><h1>Notable Azerite Traits and Essences</h1><p>This fight has a good amount of raid-wide AoE damage, and later on when multiple <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=157614/tentacle-of-drestagath">Tentacles</a> are up, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=310348/entropic-crash">Entropic Crash</a> can be deadly.
