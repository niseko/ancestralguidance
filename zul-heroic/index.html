minions get too close - you can instantly kill these adds by casting <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=370/purge">Purge </a>on them to remove their <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=273432/bound-by-shadow">Bound by Shadow</a> buff.<br>The last of Zul's abilities is <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=273359/shadow-barrage">Shadow Barrage</a> which is a single target nuke he will spam cast on random raid members.  This cast leaves a small dot that ticks every 2 seconds for 10 seconds.</p><p>Upon reaching 40% health, Zul transitions into phase 2 where he will stop spawning Forces of Blood and stop casting <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=273359/shadow-barrage">Shadow Barrage</a> and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=273365/dark-revelation">Dark Revelation</a>.  At this point, Pools of Darkness will spawn much more frequently throughout the platform, and space on the platform will begin to be restricted by the new tank mechanic, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=274358/rupturing-blood">Rupturing Blood</a>.  Upon phasing into phase 2, Zul will cast Locus of Corruption which applies multiples stacks of <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=274195/corrupted-blood">Corrupted Blood</a> to everyone in the raid, in addition he will cast <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=274271/deathwish">Deathwish</a> on raid members.<br><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=274271/deathwish">Deathwish</a> is a mind control effect that forces players to walk to the closest edge of the platform and jump off if not dispelled.  When <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=274271/deathwish">Deathwish</a> is dispelled, it causes raidwide damage based on how far the target is from the raid, and spawns minions of Zul.  Stay stacked as a raid during this phase to AoE heal effectively and make sure targets with <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=274271/deathwish">Deathwish</a> are dispelled just before they jump off the platform to reduce overall raid damage as well as saving their life.</p><h1>TALENTS</h1><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/37/zulHtalent.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px"
