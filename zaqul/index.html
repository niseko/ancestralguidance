a 4 phase encounter that slowly gains complexity as you push the boss into later phases.  Za'qul starts out only having a few abilities.  Za'qul occasionally casts <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=292565/crushing-grasp">Tentacles</a> which spawns a tentacle somewhere on the outside of the room then spawns 2 more (counter clockwise to the first spawn).  These tentacles shoot out in a straight line across the circle from their spawn point and will knockback any players in the line as well as do heavy damage (generally lethal).  Za'qul will also spawn 3 Horrific Summoners as long as at least 1 player is in the normal realm.  The last ability Za'qul has is <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=292963/dread">Dread</a>.  <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=292963/dread">Dread</a> causes 4 raid members to run in fear and deals heavy raid wide damage when dispelled.</p><p>Upon reaching 85% health, Za'qul opens the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=295173/fear-realm">Fear Realm</a> and drags the entire raid into the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=295173/fear-realm">Fear Realm</a>.  While in the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=295173/fear-realm">Fear Realm</a>, all players inside gain a stack of <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=292971/hysteria">Hysteria</a> every 15 seconds.  Za'qul also will mark two raid members with <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=293509/manifest-nightmares">Manifest Nightmares</a> which deals heavy periodic damage over a few seconds and leaves a <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=303818/nightmare-pool">Nightmare Pool</a> near the afflicted player's feet every tick.  Upon expiration a Horrific Vision will spawn from each player.  The last mechanic, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=292996/maddening-eruption">Maddening Eruption</a> will kill you if you are stood in it when it goes off.  For 20 seconds after the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=292996/maddening-eruption">Maddening Eruption</a> goes off, Za'qul takes 30% more damage.</p><p>When Za'qul reaches 70% health, he will open the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=295249/delirium-realm">Delirium Realm</a>.  This realm is mostly for DPS players as any player who enters the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=295249/delirium-realm">Delirium Realm</a> will be hostile to all other players within the realm.  As a healer, the only things to worry about is to not go into the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=295249/delirium-realm">Delirium Realm</a> (don't stand in the orange eye balls of the floor), and dispel people who are coming out of <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=295249/delirium-realm">Delirium Realm</a> with <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=295327/shattered-psyche">Shattered Psyche</a>.</p><p>Once Za'qul has been brought to 50% health, your entire raid will be pulled from whatever realm they are currently in and moved to the normal realm.  From here, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=292963/dread">Dread</a> turns to <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=296018/manic-dread">Manic Dread</a>, and Horrific Summoners can only be killed in the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=295173/fear-realm">Fear Realm</a>.  Periodically Za'qul will cast <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=301068/psychotic-split">Psychotic Split</a> which is mostly a DPS check but also spawns extra adds that will attack your tanks.  This phase is tricky since the only way to get into the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=295173/fear-realm">fear realm</a> is to use your extra action button when stood next to a Horrific Summoner.  This is also your only way out.  Maneuvering between the fear and normal realm is your only way to manage <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=292971/hysteria">Hysteria</a> stacks so ensure you always have a summoner available if you want to move between realms.</p><h1>Suggested Talents</h1><p><img

href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=198838/earthen-wall-totem">EWT</a> when your raid is stacked up with <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=292971/hysteria">Hysteria</a> stacks, and use your two charges of <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=51505/lava-burst">Lava Burst</a> to help deal damage when Za'qul is taking extra damage.</p><h1>Notable Azerite Traits and Essences</h1><p>Since you will likely be stacked due to the movement patterns of the fight, O<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=278095/overflowing-shores">verflowing Shores</a> and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=278715/spouting-spirits">Spouting Spirits</a> have good value here.  <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=303007/loyal-to-the-end">Loyal to the End</a> also isn't bad since healing raid members quickly after dispelling multiple <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=292963/dread">dread</a>s is somewhat important when <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=292971/hysteria">hysteria</a> stacks are high.  For essences, I prefer using <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=299943/life-binders-invocation">Life-Binder's Invocation</a> and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=299372/memory-of-lucid-dreams">Memory of Lucid Dreams</a>.</p><h1>Healing Tips</h1><ul><li>Assign one healer to dispel a <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=292963/dread">dread</a> marker (boss mod addons generally have an option to mark players will <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=292963/dread">Dread</a>).</li><li>Try to use at least 1 damage reduction cooldown per <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=292963/dread">Dread</a>.  <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=292963/dread">Dread</a>s are over 1 minute apart so you'll only need 3 sets of cooldowns that you can loop through.</li><li>While you can use <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=8143/tremor-totem">Tremor Totem</a> to remove all <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=292963/dread">Dread</a>s simulatneously, you generally don't want to do so unless everyone is full health, and you have two raidwide damage reduction cooldowns active.</li></ul></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated
