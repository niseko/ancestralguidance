Otherwise, stat increases are great, or taking damage traits like <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=279829/igneous-potential">Igneous Potential</a> can help your group kill the boss and organs faster. For essences, I'd recommend running <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=299370/vision-of-perfection">Vision of Perfection</a> major if you need healing or <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/azerite-essence-power/the-crucible-of-flame-47">Crucible of Flame</a> if you prefer to spec more damage oriented.</p><h1>Healing Tips</h1><ul><li> Make sure your healers are evenly spread around the room if you are using the no dispel strategy.</li><li>Have healing cooldowns available for when people may be moving to and from the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=158343/organ-of-corruption">Organs</a> - movement is the most dangerous part of this fight as people can easily clip each other with their <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=313759/cursed-blood">Cursed Blood</a> circles.</li><li> If you are targetted by a <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=159514/blood-of-nyalotha#abilities">Blood of Ny'alotha</a>, stun it when it is close to you - using hard CC like stuns, blinds, fears, and some other CC will cause the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=159514/blood-of-nyalotha#abilities">Bloods</a> to pick a new target, giving you much more time to kill them.</li><li>Make sure you aren't behind the active tank when you're spread out around the room, otherwise you can die to the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=309961/eye-of-nzoth">Eye of N'zoth</a> frontal the boss will do.</li></ul><p>If you are planning on dispelling <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=313759/cursed-blood">Cursed Bloods</a>, a more traditional healing build will be much better as the majority of the raid will be able to stack. This strategy does require precise dispels, so make sure you have a way of calling out who to dispel so that you don't accidentally wipe your raid. Each time multiple dispels are happening at the same time you want to have a healing CD available, so plan ahead of time.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 19, 2020</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/tag/boss-guides/">Boss Guides</a></li></ul><div class="post__bio bio"><img class="bio__avatar" src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/website/AEPblackwater-1024x576.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="niseko"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/" class="invert" rel="author">niseko</a></h3><p>I am the Author, call me Arthur.</p></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/carapace-of-nzoth/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Carapace of N&#x27;zoth</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/nzoth-the-corruptor/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> N&#x27;zoth the Corruptor </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Footer Section</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
