            "content_html": "<h1>Fight Mechanics</h1>\n<p>This is a much longer fight than any of the previous encounters this tier, and the phases are quite different so I am going to separate each phase into its own section to avoid confusion as much as possible. A large change from Heroic is that while each player still has access to their <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=318761/azeroths-radiance\">Heart of Azeroth</a> via an extra-action Boss Button, each player can only use their neck once in the fight and it will instead restore 25 sanity to everyone in a small area around you. More on neck usage in each of the phase breakdowns below.</p>\n<h2>Phase 1 - Psychus</h2>\n<p>This phase consists of roughly the first half of the fight, ending around 6:00 into the fight, and is likely where you're to spend most of your time during progression. There are 2 different <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=158376/psychus\">Psychus</a> groups in this phase separated by a 'burn' phase on N'zoth, and each of these 'phases' are mirrored to each other - Group 1 will enter their <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=309046/mindgate\">Mindgate</a> on the West side of the room while Group 2 will later enter their <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=309046/mindgate\">Mindgate</a> on the East side of the room. <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=158367/basher-tentacle\">Basher Tentacle</a> spawn locations are fixed in this phase, but some of the tentacles such as the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=160249/spike-tentacle\">Spike</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=158375/corruptor-tentacle\">Corruptor tentacles</a> can spawn in various locations around their respective <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=158367/basher-tentacle\">Basher Tentacles</a>. Tanks should always be tanking the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=158367/basher-tentacle\">Basher Tentacles</a> and rotate through cooldowns as they do significant tank damage, while everyone else will be focused on killing off the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=158375/corruptor-tentacle\">Corruptor</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=160249/spike-tentacle\">Spike tentacles</a> and dealing with mechanics like <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=309980/paranoia\">Paranoia</a>. To give a TLDR of the order of events, you will begin killing 2 different <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=158367/basher-tentacle\">Basher Tentacle</a> groups, <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=309980/paranoia\">Paranoia</a> will occur, and you will travel to the opposite side of the room to deal with 2 additional <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=158367/basher-tentacle\">Basher Tentacle</a> groups. After this is when the first <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=158376/psychus\">Psychus</a> group will enter their <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=309046/mindgate\">Mindgate</a>. The groups of players who do not enter the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=158376/psychus\">Psychus</a> phase will instead deal with 2 additional <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=158367/basher-tentacle\">Basher Tentacle</a> groups on their own, separated by another <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=309980/paranoia\">Paranoia</a> followed by a <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=315772/mindgrasp\">Mindgrasp</a>. It is worth noting that before the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=315772/mindgrasp\">Mindgrasp </a>there will be many <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=318896/corrupted-neuron\">Corrupted Neurons</a> - you can use hard CC like Banish, Stuns, and Blinds to avoid having to kill every single one of these, allowing you to have much more room. </p>\n<p><strong>Psychus 1</strong> - 8 players should go into the first <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=158376/psychus\">Psychus</a> phase and kill up to 8 of the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=159578/exposed-synapse\">Exposed Synapses</a> to defeat <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=158376/psychus\">Psychus</a>. The group should consist of 1 healer, 1 tank, and 6 DPS, and you will likely need to assign cooldowns to successfully defeat <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=158376/psychus\">Psychus</a> before you run out of room. About halfway through this phase this group will use <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2825/bloodlust\">Bloodlust</a> / <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=32182/heroism\">Heroism</a> as you will get a 2nd use at the end of the fight. <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=163947/psychophage\">Psychophage</a> adds will periodically cast <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=318771/devour-thoughts\">Devour Thoughts</a> which will deal damage and drain sanity - you must avoid these as well as the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=313793/flames-of-insanity\">Cataclysmic Flames</a> swirls on the floor to avoid losing all of your sanity in this phase. Once <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=158376/psychus\">Psychus</a> is defeated, you can click on your body to <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=309307/restore-consciousness\">Restore Consciousness</a> and begin the first N'zoth burn phase. At the end of this burn phase you should use 2 of your <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=318761/azeroths-radiance\">Heart of Azeroth</a>'s to 'reset' everyone's sanity back to 100 before the next set of tentacles spawn.</p>\n<p>After the first burn phase has completed, the fight will then repeat itself but you will begin on the opposite side of the room. To give a TLDR of the order of events, you will begin killing 2 different <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=158367/basher-tentacle\">Basher Tentacle</a> groups, <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=309980/paranoia\">Paranoia</a> will occur, and you will travel to the opposite side of the room to deal with 2 additional <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=158367/basher-tentacle\">Basher Tentacle</a> groups. After this is when the second <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=158376/psychus\">Psychus</a> group will enter their <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=309046/mindgate\">Mindgate</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Psychus 2</strong> - 9 players should go into the second <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=158376/psychus\">Psychus</a> phase and kill up to 8 of the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=159578/exposed-synapse\">Exposed Synapses</a> to defeat <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=158376/psychus\">Psychus</a>. The group should consist of 2 healers, 1 tank, and 6 DPS, and you will likely need to assign cooldowns to successfully defeat <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=158376/psychus\">Psychus</a> before you run out of room. The movement of <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=158376/psychus\">Psychus</a> is different from the first group, but the majority of the mechanics are still the same - you need to dodge the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=163947/psychophage\">Psychophage</a> adds, kill the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=159578/exposed-synapse\">Exposed Synapses</a>, and kill <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=158376/psychus\">Psychus</a> before the 4th Black Volley. Also, this group will have <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=315709/tread-lightly\">Tread Lightly</a>, which will cause you to take Contempt damage every time you move. To avoid this, this group should consist mostly of ranged players and at least 1 warlock as you need to use a <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=111771/demonic-gateway\">warlock gateway</a> as a group as soon as you enter the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=309046/mindgate\">Mindgate</a>. Once <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=158376/psychus\">Psychus</a> is defeated, you can click on your body to <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=309307/restore-consciousness\">Restore Consciousness</a> and begin the second N'zoth burn phase and start Phase 2. At the end of this burn phase you should use 2 - 3 of your <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=318761/azeroths-radiance\">Heart of Azeroth</a>'s to 'reset' everyone's sanity back to 100 before Phase 2.</p>\n<h2>Phase 2 - Thought Harvesters</h2>\n<p>When the first set of <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=162933/thought-harvester\">Thought Harvesters</a> have spawned, Phase 2 has officially begun. Each set of <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=162933/thought-harvester\">Thought Harvesters</a> will cast one <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=317066/harvest-thoughts\">Harvest Thoughts</a> each, and should die before the 2nd cast finishes. The first cast of <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=317066/harvest-thoughts\">Harvest Thoughts</a> should be soaked as a group on top of the boss, paired with a stacked healing CD like <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=62618/power-word-barrier\">Power Word: Barrier</a> or <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=98008/spirit-link-totem\">Spirit Link Totem</a> as the first <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=317102/evoke-anguish\">Evoke Anguish</a> will follow shortly after. To make this phase easier to follow, I'm instead going to give a TLDR of what will be happening around each <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=317102/evoke-anguish\">Evoke Anguish</a> cast. It is worth noting that <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=317102/evoke-anguish\">Evoke Anguish</a> 1 + 2 are the best times to use stacked raid CD's such as <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=196718/darkness\">Darkness</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=98008/spirit-link-totem\">Spirit Link Totem</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=62618/power-word-barrier\">Power Word: Barrier</a> as the other casts require you to be spread out.</p>\n<p><strong>Evoke Anguish 1</strong> - Stacked on top of the boss for the initial application before sprinting to the edge of the room where you should drop your first set of <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=309991/anguish\">Anguish</a> pools. This is followed by the first <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=317874/stupefying-glare\">Stupifying Glare</a> that will travel to the left, so you should aim to beat these beams to the right if possible to minimize movement. </p>\n<p><strong>Evoke Anguish 2</strong> - Shortly after the first <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=317874/stupefying-glare\">Stupifying Glare</a>, you should drop these pools as close to your previous <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=309991/anguish\">Anguish</a> pools as you can (note: previous <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=309991/anguish\">Anguish</a> pools will grow slightly during this time, so make sure you aren't too close). After you have dropped your 2nd <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=309991/anguish\">Anguish</a> pools you there will be a <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=309980/paranoia\">Paranoia</a> Cast followed by a <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=315772/mindgrasp\">Mindgrasp</a>. Sanity is not as important in this phase, so you should instead aim to meet up with your partner as quickly as possible, even if it means you have to run through a player or two to get there.</p>\n<p><strong>Evoke Anguish 3</strong> - As soon as the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=315772/mindgrasp\">Mindgrasp </a>has finished Evoke 3 will be cast. You should again drop these pools as close to the previous pools as you can to avoid taking up too much room. After you have dropped your 3rd <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=309991/anguish\">Anguish</a> pools there will be the 2nd <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=317066/harvest-thoughts\">Harvest Thoughts</a> cast - this will need to be soaked by 5 players with immunities, otherwise you will lose all of your sanity and go insane.</p>\n<p><strong>Evoke Anguish 4</strong> - After the first immunities have been used there will be the last <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=317102/evoke-anguish\">Evoke Anguish</a> of the phase followed by another set of <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=317874/stupefying-glare\">Stupifying Glare</a> beams that will travel right this time. Again, drop your pools as close to the previous <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=309991/anguish\">Anguish</a> pools as you can, and dodge the beams. </p>\n<p>After all of the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=317102/evoke-anguish\">Evoke Anguish</a> casts have completed, there will be one more Immunity soak on the 3rd set of <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=162933/thought-harvester\">Thought Harvesters</a> that spawn, as well as another <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=309980/paranoia\">Paranoia</a> followed by the last set of <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=317874/stupefying-glare\">Stupifying Glare</a> beams that will travel left again. After you have dealt with the last beam you should kill off any remaining <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=162933/thought-harvester\">Thought Harvesters</a> and use 2 more <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=318761/azeroths-radiance\">Heart of Azeroth</a>'s before you enter the Secret Phase.</p>\n<h2>Mythic-Only Secret Phase</h2>\n<p>This phase is the easiest phase of the fight and shouldn't take too many attempts to master it. You will kill a <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=163612/voidspawn-annihilator\">Voidspawn Annihilator</a> while <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=319257/disarm-countermeasure\">disarming various bombs</a> that will spawn in the room. This phase will require you to disable 11 <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=319257/disarm-countermeasure\">disable 11 bombs</a> in total, and each bomb removes your ability to use your <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=318761/azeroths-radiance\">Heart of Azeroth</a>. There are 4 sets of <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=319257/disarm-countermeasure\">bombs</a> that will spawn, and you should disarm them as follows: Set 1 - disarm the closest 2 <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=319257/disarm-countermeasure\">bombs</a>, let the 3rd expire. Set 2: disarm all 3 <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=319257/disarm-countermeasure\">bombs</a>. Set 3: disarm 3 of the 4 <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=319257/disarm-countermeasure\">bombs</a>, allow one of the far <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=319257/disarm-countermeasure\">bombs</a> to expire. Set 4: Same as set 3. Once you have killed the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=163612/voidspawn-annihilator\">Voidspawn Annihilator</a> you should toggle autowalk and click on the gateway to travel back to N'zoth to begin the final phase. </p>\n<h2>Phase 3 - Thought Harvesters</h2>\n<p>This phase is very similar to Phase 2, so I will instead only talk about the differences between the two phases. Healing CD's should roughly mimic what you did in Phase 2.</p>\n<p><strong>Evoke Anguish 1</strong> - Drop these pools to the back left and follow the beams all the way to the right.</p>\n<p><strong>Evoke Anguish 2</strong> - Drop these pools to the back right and then spread for the first <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=309980/paranoia\">Paranoia</a> followed by a <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=315772/mindgrasp\">Mindgrasp</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Evoke Anguish 3</strong> - Drop these pools at the back of the room, followed by the final <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=317066/harvest-thoughts\">Harvest Thoughts</a> immunity soak of the fight.</p>\n<p><strong>Evoke Anguish 4</strong> - Again, drop these pools at the back of the room and dodge the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=317874/stupefying-glare\">Stupifying Glare</a> beams that will travel to the left.</p>\n<p>Once all the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=317102/evoke-anguish\">Evoke Anguish</a> casts have completed, you should stack up in melee and force yourselves to go insane by stacking during the next <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=309980/paranoia\">Paranoia</a>, where you will have 20 seconds to burn down N'zoth to 2.5%. There is one final <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=317874/stupefying-glare\">Stupifying Glare</a> beam during this time that will travel to the right - because of the limited room, you should aim to dodge the beam to the left, but you should always drop a <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=65992/tremor-totem\">Tremor Totem</a> on this beam in case people get feared. </p>\n<h1>Suggested Talents</h1>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"621\" height=\"377\" src=\"https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/81/vigor-and-wind-rush.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/81/responsive/vigor-and-wind-rush-xs.jpg 300w ,https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/81/responsive/vigor-and-wind-rush-sm.jpg 480w ,https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/81/responsive/vigor-and-wind-rush-md.jpg 768w ,https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/81/responsive/vigor-and-wind-rush-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/81/responsive/vigor-and-wind-rush-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/81/responsive/vigor-and-wind-rush-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>A standard healing build is great for this fight. <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=192077/wind-rush-totem\">Wind Rush Totem</a> can be great on this fight as there is a ton of movement that will be happening, and sometimes your raid needs a burst of movement. If your group feels they don't need <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=192077/wind-rush-totem\">Wind Rush Totem</a> you should take <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=192088/graceful-spirit\">Graceful Spirit</a> as there are many times during this fight where you can be healing on the move. All 3 talents on the level 60 row are viable on this fight, and each has their own use. If your group does not have 10 total immunities, you can use <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=207399/ancestral-protection-totem\">Ancestral Protection Totem</a> to sacrifice one of your soakers without using a combat res.</p>\n<h1>Notable Azerite Traits and Essences</h1>\n<p>Popular choices on this fight are <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=278715/spouting-spirits\">Spouting Spirits</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=278095/overflowing-shores\">Overflowing Shores</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=317137/heart-of-darkness\">Heart of Darkness</a>. <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=278715/spouting-spirits\">Spouting Spirits</a> can be extremely helpful during the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=317066/harvest-thoughts\">Harvest Thoughts</a> or <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=317102/evoke-anguish\">Evoke Anguish</a> damage events when the entire raid is stacked up.

            "content_html": "<h1>Fight Mechanics</h1>\n<p><strong>Please note: This boss has two very different strategies that will change the way you heal this fight. For simplicity I will cover the no dispel strategy as it is what most guilds have opted to use for their first kill. I will post a few notes under the Healing Tips section regarding the dispel strategy.</strong></p>\n<p>Mythic Il'gynoth is very similar to its heroic version; the fight does not have very many mechanics, but each of the mechanics are important for every player. The most common strategy is to never dispel <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=313759/cursed-blood\">Cursed Blood</a> so eventually every single player will have <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=313759/cursed-blood\">Cursed Blood</a> on them. This means that every player will need to be spread out at least 11 yards, which makes it very hard, if not impossible, to use spells like <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=254423/chain-heal\">Chain Heal</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=73920/healing-rain\">Healing Rain</a> effectively. This does, however, eliminate the majority of the mind controls from <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=311367/touch-of-the-corruptor\">Touch of the Corruptor</a>, which means you only have to deal with the mechanic once. Periodically 3 players will be targetted by <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=310319/corruptors-gaze\">Corruptor's Gaze</a>, making them kite around the beam that spawns beneath them, leaving behind a pool of <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=310322/morass-of-corruption\">Morass</a> which will silence and deal a good amount of damage if you step in the pools. Each player should try to stay near previous <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=310322/morass-of-corruption\">Morass</a> puddles to maximize the amount of space in the room while staying at least 11 yards apart to prevent <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=313759/cursed-blood\">Cursed Blood</a> from cleaving.</p>\n<p>When Il'gynoth dies, it will spawn 3 <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=158343/organ-of-corruption\">Organs of Corruption</a> which will cast <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=310788/pumping-blood\">Pumping Blood</a> roughly every 12 seconds - as a shaman you can solo kick one of these <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=158343/organ-of-corruption\">Organs</a> by yourself, and you should do so for at least the first group that spawns so that the majority of your dps can be on one of the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=158343/organ-of-corruption\">Organs</a>. If <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=310788/pumping-blood\">Pumping Blood</a> finishes the cast it will spawn  a <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=159514/blood-of-nyalotha#abilities\">Blood of Ny'alotha</a> which will <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=315094/fixate\">fixate</a> a player and give them stacks of <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=312486/recurring-nightmare\">Recurring Nightmare</a> if it attacks them. Once an <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=158343/organ-of-corruption\">Organ</a> is killed it will continuously spawn <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=159514/blood-of-nyalotha#abilities\">Bloods</a> from it, which acts as the soft enrage of the fight. The goal is to kill Il'gynoth 4 times while not becoming overrun by adds or running out of room before the boss enrages at 10 minutes.</p>\n<h1>Suggested Talents</h1>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/79/Capture.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/79/responsive/Capture-xs.jpg 300w ,https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/79/responsive/Capture-sm.jpg 480w ,https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/79/responsive/Capture-md.jpg 768w ,https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/79/responsive/Capture-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/79/responsive/Capture-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/79/responsive/Capture-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"619\" height=\"379\" /></p>\n<p>The talent setup is atypical, but because we're unable to make use of <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=254423/chain-heal\">Chain Heal</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=197995/wellspring\">Wellspring</a> we're kind of forced to play <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=114049/ascendance\">Ascendance</a>. <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=207401/ancestral-vigor\">Ancestral Vigor</a> can give people some much needed health if someone dies with <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=313759/cursed-blood\">Cursed Blood</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=216251/undulation\">Undulation</a> will likely be better than <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=73685/unleash-life\">Unleash Life</a> due to the heavy amount of <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=8004/healing-surge\">Healing Surge</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=77472/healing-wave\">Healing Wave</a> casts.</p>\n<h1>Notable Azerite Traits and Essences</h1>\n<p>We don't have great azerite traits for a fight like this - the healing requirement is not high enough to warrant stacking traits like <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=287302/turn-of-the-tide\">Turn of the Tide</a>, although I would definitely recommend having at least 1 of them. Otherwise, stat increases are great, or taking damage traits like <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=279829/igneous-potential\">Igneous Potential</a> can help your group kill the boss and organs faster. For essences, I'd recommend running <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=299370/vision-of-perfection\">Vision of Perfection</a> major if you need healing or <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/azerite-essence-power/the-crucible-of-flame-47\">Crucible of Flame</a> if you prefer to spec more damage oriented.</p>\n<h1>Healing Tips</h1>\n<ul>\n<li> Make sure your healers are evenly spread around the room if you are using the no dispel strategy.</li>\n<li>Have healing cooldowns available for when people may be moving to and from the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=158343/organ-of-corruption\">Organs</a> - movement is the most dangerous part of this fight as people can easily clip each other with their <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=313759/cursed-blood\">Cursed Blood</a> circles.</li>\n<li> If you are targetted by a <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=159514/blood-of-nyalotha#abilities\">Blood of Ny'alotha</a>, stun it when it is close to you - using hard CC like stuns, blinds, fears, and some other CC will cause the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=159514/blood-of-nyalotha#abilities\">Bloods</a> to pick a new target, giving you much more time to kill them.</li>\n<li>Make sure you aren't behind the active tank when you're spread out around the room, otherwise you can die to the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=309961/eye-of-nzoth\">Eye of N'zoth</a> frontal the boss will do.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are planning on dispelling <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=313759/cursed-blood\">Cursed Bloods</a>, a more traditional healing build will be much better as the majority of the raid will be able to stack. This strategy does require precise dispels, so make sure you have a way of calling out who to dispel so that you don't accidentally wipe your raid. Each time multiple dispels are happening at the same time you want to have a healing CD available, so plan ahead of time.</p>\n",

            "content_html": "<h1>Fight Mechanics</h1>\n<p>This is a 3 Phase encounter and each phase is pretty unique, so I am going to breakdown each phase on its own.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 1</strong>: In this phase you'll have access to your <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/item=169223/ashjrakamas-shroud-of-resolve\">on-use cloak</a> as an additional boss button in the fight that will restore all of your Sanity and instantly heal you to full. This phase is similar to its heroic version, however the tentacles that slam the ground spawn in set locations on Mythic, making this phase even more scripted than its heroic version. The first set of tentacles that spawn will have 4 tentacles - 2 of them slam down in the front and 2 of them slam down in the back, separated by a small gap in the center. You still need to kill all of the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=157486/horrific-hemorrhage\">Horrific Hemorrhages</a> that spawn on them so that they disappear. The second set of tentacles will spawn in a V formation, cutting off your ability to get to the back of the room near Wrathion. To counter this, you can either leave before the tentacles slam down, or use your cloak to teleport to the back of the room. There will also be 2 <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=157442/gaze-of-madness#abilities\">Gaze of Madness</a> adds each time they spawn, and each needs to be killed quickly to limit the sanity loss and damage that they deal. Generally you want to interrupt each of them at least once as soon as the channel of <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=307008/breed-madness\">Breed Madness</a> has begun (not the cast of the spell) to limit sanity drain and damage done. Like heroic, <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=306973/madness-bomb\">Madness Bomb</a> will periodically fear 3 players, so if you or someone you're close to is affected you can use <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=65992/tremor-totem\">Tremor Totem</a> to break the fear.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 2</strong>: At the start of Phase 2 every players sanity will reset for the final time in the fight, meaning you need to make use of <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=317896/shard-of-sanity\">Shards of Sanity</a> from killing <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=316848/adaptive-membrane\">Adaptive Membrane</a> shields that apply to both friendlies and enemies. The <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=157475/synthesis-growth\">Synthesis Growths</a> are in similar locations as the heroic difficulty, with the right side being much more grouped up than the left side. The raid will need to be split into 2 groups and DPS should balance out their cooldowns on the various <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=157475/synthesis-growth\">Synthesis Growths</a> in such a way that both sides finish at roughly the same time. The <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=317165/regenerative-expulsion\">Regenerative Expulsion</a> cast from the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=157461/mycelial-cyst\">Mycelial Cysts</a> on the floor only happens after the cysts have been targeted - imagine each of the cysts has an internal timer of 15 - 20 seconds until they begin their <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=317165/regenerative-expulsion\">Regenerative Expulsion</a> cast once a damage event has hit them, giving you a small window of time before the floor is pulsing with heavy AoE damage. To counter this, you can stay stacked up as a group to avoid cleaving any future <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=157461/mycelial-cyst\">Mycelial Cysts</a> so they won't be casting <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=317165/regenerative-expulsion\">Regenerative Expulsion</a> while you're killing the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=157475/synthesis-growth\">Synthesis Growths</a> near them. Don't stand in the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=157461/mycelial-cyst\">Mycelial Cysts</a> for long periods of time, kill the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=157475/synthesis-growth\">Synthesis Growths</a> as quickly as possible, spread out when you have <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=306973/madness-bomb\">Madness Bomb</a>, and collect <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=317896/shard-of-sanity\">Shard of Sanity</a> as a group to maximize your groups sanity during the phase. The small intermission once each side has been cleared is removed on Mythic difficulty, and instead the boss will immediately run to begin Phase 3.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 3</strong>: Each <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=307808/eternal-darkness\">Eternal Darkness</a> cast will leave a giant pool of darkness on the ground that grows from a targeted players position. You should plan on getting at least 4 <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=307808/eternal-darkness\">Eternal Darkness</a> casts, likely 5, and will need some sort of movement speed effect like a <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=111771/demonic-gateway\">Warlock Gateway</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=192077/wind-rush-totem\">Wind Rush Totem</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/item=152497/lightfoot-potion\">Speed Potions</a> for each of the casts. There are also 3 <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=306984/insanity-bomb\">Insanity Bomb</a> casts in this phase, each roughly 1 minute apart from each other, meaning you can use <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=65992/tremor-totem\">Tremor Totem</a> on each cast. You can have preset spread positions so you don't accidentally cleave other people, maximizing the amount of Sanity you have in the phase. After each movement at least 3 tentacles will slam down near your position, so make sure you don't get hit by these, especially if you're trying to stand in the pool of darkness to break your <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=316848/adaptive-membrane\">Adaptive Membrane</a> shield. In addition to the boss's <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=316848/adaptive-membrane\">Adaptive Membrane</a>, 3 players will also be affected - they will need to run into the previous pool of darkness created from <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=307808/eternal-darkness\">Eternal Darkness</a> in order to break the shield, and a <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=317896/shard-of-sanity\">Shard of Sanity</a> will come out of each player who breaks the shield - note: the sanity orb will travel in the direction you're facing, so make sure you're facing the boss.</p>\n<h1>Suggested Talents</h1>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/80/Standard-Talents-Wind-Rush.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/80/responsive/Standard-Talents-Wind-Rush-xs.jpg 300w ,https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/80/responsive/Standard-Talents-Wind-Rush-sm.jpg 480w ,https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/80/responsive/Standard-Talents-Wind-Rush-md.jpg 768w ,https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/80/responsive/Standard-Talents-Wind-Rush-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/80/responsive/Standard-Talents-Wind-Rush-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/80/responsive/Standard-Talents-Wind-Rush-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"623\" height=\"388\" /></p>\n<p>A pretty normal talent setup works well for this fight. <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=207401/ancestral-vigor\">Ancestral Vigor</a> can be helpful in both Phase 2 and Phase 3, so use it if you feel you need the extra health during high moments of damage. <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=192077/wind-rush-totem\">Wind Rush Totem</a> is very strong on this fight for the last phase, as you will likely use some sort of movement mechanic (i.e. <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=192077/wind-rush-totem\">Wind Rush Totem</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=111771/demonic-gateway\">Warlock Gateway</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/item=152497/lightfoot-potion\">Speed Potions</a> each time the boss casts Eternal Darkness.</p>\n<h1>Notable Azerite Traits and Essences</h1>\n<p>Phase 3 will require some burst healing each time Eternal Darkness is cast, so having at least 1 <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=278715/spouting-spirits\">Spouting Spirits</a> is very helpful during this phase.

In Phase 3, <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=65992/tremor-totem\">Tremor Totem</a> will be available for every <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=306984/insanity-bomb\">Insanity Bomb</a> so make sure to use it.</li>\n<li>As stated above, <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=192077/wind-rush-totem\">Wind Rush Totem</a> is invaluable for your group during some of the movement in Phase 3 so make sure you know when your team wants to use it. Generally, the movement is as follows for each Eternal Darkness: <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=111771/demonic-gateway\">Warlock Gateway</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=192077/wind-rush-totem\">Wind Rush Totem</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/item=152497/lightfoot-potion\">Speed Potions</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=111771/demonic-gateway\">Warlock Gateway</a>, and then <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=192077/wind-rush-totem\">Wind Rush Totem</a> if you need to move one last time.</li>\n<li>Any time you are able to break your <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=316848/adaptive-membrane\">Adaptive Membrane</a> shield you will spawn a sanity orb that will travel in front of your character - make sure you're facing towards your group, especially in Phase 3 if you get this mechanic.</li>\n<li>Many players opt to use a Mouseover focus macro for warlock gateways on this fight. Below is a quick \"How to\" in order to properly set this up.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Warlock Gateway + Interact with mouseover setup</strong>: 1) Make a focus mouseover macro: <b>/focus [@mouseover]</b><br />\n2) Bind it to something you can easily press. You can test that this is working my making sure you gain a focus target.<br />\n3) Go to the Game Menu (escape) -&gt; Key Bindings -&gt; Targeting -&gt; <b>Interact with mouseover</b>. Make sure to bind this; you can test to make sure it is working by using your focus mouseover macro you just setup (you should gain a focus target) and then use your Interact with mouseover bind while hovering over your focus frame. If you gain a target, it is working properly and will allow you to use a warlock gateway without having to repeatedly click on it if multiple people are on top of it.</p>\n",

            "content_html": "<h1>Fight Mechanics</h1>\n<p>This fight does not change much from its Heroic difficulty, instead there are just more adds that spawn and failing to keep them under control will eventually cause your raid to wipe. There are 3 types of adds, the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=157614/tentacle-of-drestagath\">Tentacle of Drest'agath</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=157612/eye-of-drestagath\">Eye of Drest'agath</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=157613/maw-of-drestagath\">Maw of Drest'agath</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=157614/tentacle-of-drestagath\">Tentacles</a> are generally the most important adds to manage on the fight because they periodically cast <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=310348/entropic-crash\">Entropic Crash</a> along with the boss which will deal heavy falloff damage to the entire raid. Having too many <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=157614/tentacle-of-drestagath\">Tentacles</a> alive at once can easily cause a wipe, so they should generally be the first thing your group tries to kill. The <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=157613/maw-of-drestagath\">Maws of Drest'agath</a> will periodically cast <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=310584/acid-splash&amp;dd=14&amp;ddsize=30\">Acid Splash</a>, which will do AoE damage on a targetted player. The <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=157613/maw-of-drestagath\">Maws</a> will also apply a healing absorb to players who are close to them, so ranged DPS should primarily focus these adds down while the melee keep the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=157614/tentacle-of-drestagath\">Tentacles</a> under control. <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=157612/eye-of-drestagath\">The Eyes of Drest'agath</a> will randomly target a player in line of sight and channel <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=310552/mind-flay&amp;dd=14&amp;ddsize=30\">Mind Flay</a> on them which does a good amount of damage over time to the player. Because the Eyes can be interrupted, they should be the last of the adds your group should worry about. Each time an add is killed it will trigger its <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=308941/throes-of-agony\">Death Throes</a> ability, causing all similar add types to also trigger their ability at the same time. Generally, this is not too dangerous to worry about, but if you have multiple of one add type alive it is something you should be aware of. The tanks will take turns debuffing the adds with <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=310277/volatile-seed\">Volatile Seed</a> - this will debuff you if you are within the circle when it expires, so make sure you are giving your tanks room to drop off the debuffs where they need to. Finally, each time an add of any type dies, it will drop 4 <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=308377/void-infused-ichor\">Void Infused Ichor</a> for players to pick up. You should have your DPS primarily get these to damage the boss, and grab them as a healer whenever you believe one of them is going to expire.</p>\n<h1>Suggested Talents</h1>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/77/Standard-Talents.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/77/responsive/Standard-Talents-xs.jpg 300w ,https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/77/responsive/Standard-Talents-sm.jpg 480w ,https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/77/responsive/Standard-Talents-md.jpg 768w ,https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/77/responsive/Standard-Talents-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/77/responsive/Standard-Talents-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/77/responsive/Standard-Talents-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"383\" /></p>\n<p>A standard talent setup works fine on this boss. <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=192077/wind-rush-totem\">Wind Rush Totem</a> may be nice for your group at some points as there will be a good amount of movement around the room, especially for the melee group moving from add set to add set.</p>\n<h1>Notable Azerite Traits and Essences</h1>\n<p>This fight has a good amount of raid-wide AoE damage, and later on when multiple <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=157614/tentacle-of-drestagath\">Tentacles</a> are up, <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=310348/entropic-crash\">Entropic Crash</a> can be deadly. Having at least 1 <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=278715/spouting-spirits\">Spouting Spirits</a> is nice for these moments, otherwise I would recommend using popular traits such as <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=278095/overflowing-shores\">Overflowing Shores</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=317137/heart-of-darkness\">Heart of Darkness</a>.

To avoid being feared, you should have a kick rotation set up for each of the 3 adds that spawn, with ranged kicks prioritizing the 2nd and 3rd adds as the boss will be too far away to allow melee to interrupt them right away. As for <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=312336/void-ritual\">Void Ritual</a>, there are 4 sets that will occur on Mythic, each of them will have the exact same pillar spawns each time. The only thing that changes is the position of the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=314202/void-orb\">Void Orb</a> spawn and the 'goal' may swap positions. It is also important to note that sets 1 and 4 are identical, so once your first group has successfully scored a goal it may be worthwhile to allow your fourth group to have a few tries to minimize wipes later on. All of the other mechanics such as <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=311383/torment\">Torment</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=306228/soul-flay\">Soul Flay</a>, and the ticking damage from <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=305792/anguish\">Anguish</a> all remain from Heroic difficulty.</p>\n<h1>Suggested Healing Talents</h1>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/74/Standard-Talents.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/74/responsive/Standard-Talents-xs.jpg 300w ,https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/74/responsive/Standard-Talents-sm.jpg 480w ,https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/74/responsive/Standard-Talents-md.jpg 768w ,https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/74/responsive/Standard-Talents-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/74/responsive/Standard-Talents-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/74/responsive/Standard-Talents-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"383\" /></p>\n<p>A standard talent setup is fine for this fight.

For essences, there is constant ticking damage so I'd recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=299370/vision-of-perfection\">Vision of Perfection</a> major.</p>\n<h1>Healing Tips</h1>\n<ul>\n<li> While the fight does require a fair bit of healing, the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=305792/anguish\">Anguish</a> damage is almost never lethal and therefore you should opt to use raid-wide damage reductions like <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=98008/spirit-link-totem\">Spirit Link Totem</a> when <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=306228/soul-flay\">Soul Flay</a> is ending to prevent deaths.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=65992/tremor-totem\">Tremor Totem</a> is great on this fight as it can help prevent a missed interrupt on the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=162432/awakened-terror\">Awakened Terror</a> adds. Be careful to watch kicks during the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=312336/void-ritual\">Void Ritual</a> groups to see if any are about to be missed so you can drop your <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=65992/tremor-totem\">Tremor Totem</a>. Additionally, if you have multiple shamans you can opt to chain <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=65992/tremor-totem\">Tremor Totems</a> once the 2nd and 3rd adds spawn to ensure coverage on the harder adds.</li>\n<li>Help interrupt either the 2nd or the 3rd add that spawns. <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=57994/wind-shear\">Wind Shear</a> is a low CD ranged kick that is very powerful on a fight like this. There are multiple WeakAuras (found on <a href=\"https://wago.io/\">Wago.io</a>) that can help alert you when your kick is up next.</li>\n<li>Remember that while healers are doing the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=312336/void-ritual\">Void Rituals</a> there will probably be less healing going out as they're focused on scoring their goals. If multiple healers are going at once you may opt to use things like <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108280/healing-tide-totem\">Healing Tide Totem</a> to help out.</li>\n</ul>\n",

As always, <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=317137/heart-of-darkness\">Heart of Darkness</a> provides a lot of stats and should be used if you have access to it and meet the corruption requirements. For essences you should run <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=299370/vision-of-perfection\">Vision of Perfection</a> major as people are very rarely at 100% health so it will almost always do effective healing.

When an Essence is absorbed there are 3 different things that happen per essence: An add will spawn, there will be an initial burst of damage or healing absorb applied, and players will be affected by that Essences' mechanic which will need to be dealt with.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 1</strong> - Kill Void, Absorb Nightmare and Vita: This is what most guilds opt to do for their 1st set of Essence spawns. When the boss absorbs Nightmare, players will need to be spread by 5 yards to avoid cleaving with <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=313114/unleashed-nightmare\">Unleashed Nightmare</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=160937/night-terror\">Night Terror</a> will spawn, and 5 stacks of <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=313109/unstable-nightmare\">Unstable Nightmare</a> will affect a random player. The player with <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=313109/unstable-nightmare\">Unstable Nightmare</a> will want to run close to melee so that melee can start rotating through the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=313109/unstable-nightmare\">Unstable Nightmare</a> mechanic.<br />\nAdditionally, Vita will be absorbed causing <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=306115/unleashed-vita\">Unleashed Vita</a> to do initial heavy damage, a <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=157365/crackling-stalker\">Crackling Stalker</a> to spawn, and <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=306257/unstable-vita\">Unstable Vita</a> to affect a random player. The player with <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=306257/unstable-vita\">Unstable Vita</a> should go to your designated first marker to allow the next person in the ranged group to take the next hit.

The boss will again absorb Nightmare so the same mechanics will apply - the only change is that most groups opt to have their ranged deal with the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=313109/unstable-nightmare\">Unstable Nightmare</a> mechanic this time, as melee have a far easier time to deal with the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=306634/unstable-void\">Unstable Void</a> mechanic.<br />\nWhen the boss absorbs Void it will trigger <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=306184/unleashed-void\">Unleashed Void</a>, creating a big healing absorb shield, spawn a <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=157366/void-hunter\">Void Hunter</a>, and cause the first <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=306634/unstable-void\">Unstable Void</a> circle to spawn, which needs to be soaked by a player. It is worth noting that <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=306634/unstable-void\">Unstable Void</a> will travel in the direction you're facing when it hits, so you can face it into a wall or object to make it stay near the boss on the wall without any trouble. Anyone not dealing with <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=306634/unstable-void\">Unstable Void</a> or <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=313109/unstable-nightmare\">Nightmare</a> need to be killing the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=157366/void-hunter\">Void Hunter</a> &gt; <strong>Boss</strong> &gt; <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=160937/night-terror\">Night Terror</a>.

All of the mechanics at this point have been seen already, Ranged should deal with the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=306257/unstable-vita\">Unstable Vita</a> mechanic while melee deal with the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=306634/unstable-void\">Unstable Void</a> mechanic.

Tanks will need to be sitting at roughly half health as much as possible so they don't die to <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=313213/decaying-strike\">Decaying Strike</a> while healers make sure to not top off players who have <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=316065/corrupted-existence\">Corrupted Existence</a>. Occasionally there will be large purple circles on the floor, <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=310003/void-eruption\">Void Eruption</a>, that need to be dodged, as well as <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=310019/charged-bonds\">Charged bonds</a> linking a few players together.

These areas run left and right, and Vexiona will always target a player with <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=307218/twilight-decimator\">Twilight Decimator</a>, meaning it's able to be baited. You should group up at one location and move to the next - we opted to start on the outside, move to inner/stairs, next to middle, and finally back to the outside because the breath does not completely disappear by the time the next one has begun, so this always gave us a 'safe' area to move to.

The <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=307218/twilight-decimator\">Twilight Decimator</a> intermissions happen roughly twice in the first phase.</p>\n<p>At 40% the boss will transition into the last phase, requiring players to be near another player to avoid <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=307284/terrifying-presence\">Terrifying Presence</a>. Tanks should stay stacked at all times with each other and need to be sure they don't leave their <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=310325/desolation\">Desolation</a> target behind. You should plan for 3 <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=307639/heart-of-darkness\">Heart of Darkness</a> casts in this phase, each of which will deal heavy damage and require some tricky positioning to avoid taking more damage from the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=307639/heart-of-darkness\">Heart of Darkness</a> cast as well as avoiding the Shadow of Vexiona and the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=307218/twilight-decimator\">Twilight Decimator</a> cast it does.

            "content_html": "<h1>Fight Mechanics</h1>\n<p>The Hivemind is a 1 Phase encounter, however each boss will gain unique abilities whenever they control the Hivemind. Right away Tek'ris will gain control of the Hivemind by casting <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=307213/tekriss-hivemind-control\">Tek'ris's Hivemind Control</a>. This will do a large amount of raid-wide damage and require the bosses to be at least within 20 yards of each other. Additionally, any adds that spawn under Tek'ris's control will gain damage and movement speed every second that they're alive, so it's important to kill them quickly once they are stacked up to prevent running out of room due to the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=313676/acidic-blood\">Acidic Blood</a> they drop when killed. Both <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=307232/echoing-void\">Echoing Void</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=313441/spawn-acidic-aqir\">Spawn Acidic Aqir</a> happen throughout the fight regardless of who has control of the Hivemind, so it is important to properly spread or dodge these abilities when they're active. The bosses will swap control of the Hivemind roughly every 1:15 which will always cause heavy raid-wide damage, and this is what you should be saving your healing CD's for.</p>\n<p>When <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=307201/kazirs-hivemind-control\">Ka'zir's Hivemind Control</a> is cast, the bosses will need to be separated by at least 20 yards or they will reduce their damage taken by 99%. Additionally, any adds that are active during this time will heal for 3% of their health per second, so adds need to be focused down or else you will start to become overwhelmed. Ka'zir will also cast <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=313652/mind-numbing-nova\">Mind-Numbing Nova</a> throughout the fight that needs to be interrupted - shamans are excellent at this because <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=57994/wind-shear\">Wind Shear</a> has a low cooldown, however anyone is capable of doing this paired with whoever is tanking the boss. Ka'zir will also buff one of the  adds and they will start a 20-second <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=314583/volatile-eruption\">Volatile Eruption</a> cast. This will deal heavy damage but will not overlap with the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=310402/devouring-frenzy\">Devouring Frenzy</a> damage, so unless people are getting hit by the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=313441/spawn-acidic-aqir\">Acidic Aqir</a> adds the damage should not be lethal.</p>\n<p>The final type of adds that will spawn throughout the fight are the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=157256/aqir-darter\">Aqir Darters</a>, who will repeatedly cast <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=307217/psionic-resonance\">Psionic Resonance</a> which will deal some AoE damage. These adds can be CC'd using stuns, knockbacks, disorients, among other CC, and should be to reduce damage taken by the abilities.</p>\n<h1>Suggested Talents</h1>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/72/Standard-Talents.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/72/responsive/Standard-Talents-xs.jpg 300w ,https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/72/responsive/Standard-Talents-sm.jpg 480w ,https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/72/responsive/Standard-Talents-md.jpg 768w ,https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/72/responsive/Standard-Talents-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/72/responsive/Standard-Talents-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/72/responsive/Standard-Talents-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"383\" /></p>\n<p>A standard talent setup is fine for this fight. If you feel your group is struggling with one of the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=314583/volatile-eruption\">Volatile Eruption</a> casts you can opt to take <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=207399/ancestral-protection-totem\">Ancestral Protection Totem</a> to give your raid the extra health buffer they may need.</p>\n<h1>Notable Azerite Traits and Essences</h1>\n<p>During <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=310402/devouring-frenzy\">Devouring Frenzy</a> damage there are times where the entire raid can be stacked up and receive lots of healing, which makes things like <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=278715/spouting-spirits\">Spouting Spirits</a> quite strong if you can get a good use out of it. As always, <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=317137/heart-of-darkness\">Heart of Darkness</a> provides lots of stats and should be used if you have access to it and can meet the corruption requirements. For essences I would recommend using <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=299370/vision-of-perfection\">Vision of Perfection</a> in either the major or minor slot as it allows you to use <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108280/healing-tide-totem\">Healing Tide Totem</a> on every other cast of <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=310402/devouring-frenzy\">Devouring Frenzy</a>, which requires lots of healing.</p>\n<h1>Healing Tips</h1>\n<ul>\n<li> Dodging the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=313441/spawn-acidic-aqir\">Acidic Aqir</a> adds is generally the hardest part of this encounter. If you are struggling with this, try standing nearby to an egg when they spawn, and move into its position whenever it rolls away from you. Similar to the Scythes on Mythic Argus in Legion, the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=313441/spawn-acidic-aqir\">Acidic Aqir</a> adds generally don't go through each other's spawn locations, so they are typically safe areas.</li>\n<li>Use <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108280/healing-tide-totem\">Healing Tide Totem</a> on every other cast of <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=310402/devouring-frenzy\">Devouring Frenzy</a> to help sustain your group during the heavy damage.</li>\n<li>If your group is struggling with kicks on <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=313652/mind-numbing-nova\">Mind-Numbing Nova</a>, make sure to have Ka'zir targetted so that you can backup your team with <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=57994/wind-shear\">Wind Shear</a> if needed.</li>\n<li>Drop <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=192058/capacitor-totem\">Capacitor Totem</a> on the <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/npc=157256/aqir-darter\">Aqir Darters</a> to interrupt their <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=307217/psionic-resonance\">Psionic Resonance</a> cast to reduce damage taken by them.</li>\n</ul>\n",
