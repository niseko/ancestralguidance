While most mechanics in this fight deal smaller amounts of damage compared to other encounters, they can be very lethal when paired with high stacks of Annihilation. When any player is struck by any of Mythrax's abilities in Phase 1, they will drop some Existence Fragments and gain stacks of Annihilation. You are able to reduce stacks of Annihilation by running through Existence Fragments. In phase 1 of the encounter you will face Mythrax alone. During this time, Mythrax has three abilities that affect healers, all of these abilities force your raid to be spread. The first of which is Obliteration Blast. Mythrax will aim Obliteration Blast at a random raid member and shot a massive beam at them dealing damage to anyone caught in the blast and applying stacks of Annihilation as well. Next is Oblivion Sphere which effectively mind controls random raid members by placing a large shadow orb on them which causes them to remain mind controlled until they are moved out of the circle. Any damage caused to players afflicted by Oblivion Sphere will knock them away from the source of the damage.

data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor="">Annihilation</a> as well.<br>Next is <a style="font-size: 15px; background-color: #dddddd;" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=272407/oblivion-sphere" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor="">Oblivion Sphere</a> which effectively mind controls random raid members by placing a large shadow orb on them which causes them to remain mind controlled until they are moved out of the circle.  Any damage caused to players afflicted by <a style="font-size: 15px; background-color: #dddddd;" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=272407/oblivion-sphere" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor="">Oblivion Sphere</a> will knock them away from the source of the damage.<br>Lastly, <a style="font-size: 15px; background-color: #dddddd;" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=272536/imminent-ruin" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor="">Imminent Ruin</a> is a damage over time debuff that explodes at the end of the duration.  The damage of the explosion hits everyone in the raid, but is reduced the further the target with <a style="font-size: 15px; background-color: #dddddd;" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=272536/imminent-ruin" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor="">Imminent Ruin</a> is from the other raid members.</p><p>Phase 2 happens when Mythrax hits 66% and 33% - this phase starts by Mythrax running to the center of the room and reducing all damage taken by 99%.  He then summons two N'raqi Destroyers and casts multiple <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=272407/oblivion-sphere">Oblivion Sphere</a>s, shortly after the Spheres spawn, Mythrax will rotate between Spawning Visions of Madness and casting <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=274113/obliteration-beam">Obliteration Beam</a>.  Make sure you dodge<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=274113/obliteration-beam"> Obliteration Beam</a>, and have your group stack on one of the N'raqi Destroyers to counter the raid damage from <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=272336/annihilation">Annihilation</a> and the Visions of Madness.  When Mythrax leaves this phase to go back into phase one, any adds that are still alive will still need to be dealt with.</p><p>When Mythrax hits 20% health, he will cast <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=279013/essence-shatter">Essence Shatter</a>.  This creates a tight enrage since <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=272336/annihilation">Annihilation</a> stacks will continue to grow at this point.</p><h1>TALENTS</h1><p><img loading="lazy"
