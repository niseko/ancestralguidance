Ideally you will want to have everyone keep their stacks of Lingering Infection low due to the new interaction Lingering Infection has with Contagion. When Vectis casts Contagion, any players with 6 or more stacks of LI will trigger Bursting Lesions. This causes the players afflicted to pulse moderate damage to any other players within 5 yards. If any players have 12 stacks of LI when Contagion is cast, an Engorged Parasite will spawn which casts Caustic Bile and Parasitic Discharge. If you somehow get to 25 or more stacks, and Contagion is cast, you will trigger Terminal Eruption which will instantly kill any players at 25 or more stacks and deal large raid wide damage to all other players.

are looking to maximize stacked healing.  This comes in the form of <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=197995/wellspring">Wellspring </a>and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=207778/downpour">Downpour</a>.  Two talent rows that can be changed are the 60 and 75 talent rows.  None of the tier 60 talents really shine on Vectis, although <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=198838/earthen-wall-totem">Earthen Wall Totem</a> can help in healing some damage from <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=265129/omega-vector">OV</a> and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=267242/contagion">Cont</a>.  <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=192088/graceful-spirit">Graceful Spirit</a> isn't super amazing on this fight since you will only need to move is in phase 2.  You can consider taking <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=30884/natures-guardian">NG</a>, but you will likely never proc it outside of any pull that is going to be a wipe.</p><h1>Notable Azerite Traits</h1><p><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=278095/overflowing-shores">Overflowing Shores</a> is one of the better Azerite traits mostly due to the size increase of <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=73920/healing-rain">Healing Rain</a>.  You should be able to cover all four stack points of <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=265129/omega-vector">Omega Vector</a> with one or two <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=278095/overflowing-shores">Overflowing Shore</a> traits.  <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=279504/spouting-spirits">Sprouting Spirits</a> isn't a bad option as you can use it to clear <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=265206/immunosuppression">immunosuppression</a> easier.  <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=277926/ancestral-resonance">Ancestral Resonance</a> is a decent option since you can generally get two uses of 5 minute cooldowns on this fight.</p><h1>Mythic Healing Tips</h1><ul><li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=197995/wellspring">Wellspring</a> lines up very closely to every <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=265206/immunosuppression">Immunosuppression</a> cast.  Ensure you are casting <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=197995/wellspring">Wellspring</a> after <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=265206/immunosuppression">Immunosuppression</a> goes out and at least twice during every phase 2.  <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=197995/wellspring">Wellspring</a> should be used almost on cooldown every time it is up.</li><li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=73920/healing-rain">Healing Rain</a> is mandatory on this fight.  Keep it down during phase 1 at all times.</li><li>Rotate cooldowns efficiently, do not overlap healing cooldowns as this fight is intense due to the amount of healing <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=265206/immunosuppression">Immunosuppression</a> absorbs.</li></ul></div><footer
