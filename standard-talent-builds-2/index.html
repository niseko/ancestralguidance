While competitive with both other options, it requires the most management in the tier and needs to be used effectively and constantly to maintain its edge. It is useful for constant raid damage as well as short interval burst damage.  It is important to note that <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=73685/unleash-life"><b>Unleash Life</b></a> can be used while in <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=45528/ghost-wolf"><b>Ghost Wolf</b></a>.</p><h3><h2 dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Echo of the Elements</h2></h3><p><a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=108283/echo-of-the-elements">Echo of the Elements</a> provides many players with a nice quality of life buff, as having additional charges of abilities makes it less important to watch cooldowns like a hawk. <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=108283/echo-of-the-elements">Echo of the Elements</a> allows you to effectively use your <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=61295/riptide">Riptide</a>s as well as <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=5394/healing-stream-totem">Healing Stream Totem</a>s.  This talent gains considerable power when combined with <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=157153/cloudburst-totem">Cloudburst Totem</a>.</p><h3>Deluge</h3><p>This talent has low impact on most encounters.  <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=200076/deluge">Deluge</a> assists with heavy stacked fights where a majority of your raid is in <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=73920/healing-rain">Healing Rain</a> and you need to be consistently casting <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=1064/chain-heal">Chain Heal</a>s to keep up with the damage.  Almost all value of this talent is lost if you are not spec’d into <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=157154/high-tide" data-wplink-edit="true">High Tide</a> or stacked for the majority of an encounter.</p><h3><h2 dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Earth Shield</h2></h3><p><a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=974/earth-shield"><b>Earth Shield</b></a> makes a return in Battle for Azeroth as our option to increase single target healing to one individual.  It provides a 10% healing increase to all healing done to the target with <b><a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=974/earth-shield">Earth Shield</a> </b>from any Restoration Shaman spells or talents.  Due to the nature of <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=1064/chain-heal"><b>Chain Heal</b></a>’s bounce healing calculation it is <b>NOT</b> beneficial to <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=1064/chain-heal"><b>Chain Heal</b></a> exclusively off your <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=974/earth-shield"><b>Earth Shield</b></a> target as the bounces do not benefit from the 10% healing increase.</p><h3>Spirit Wolf</h3><p>Much like the artifact talent <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=207351/ghost-in-the-mist">Ghost in the Mist</a>, this is a stacking damage reduction as well as movement speed increase.  In most raid encounters <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=45528/ghost-wolf">Ghost Wolf</a> is used frequently to move from mechanics.  Even if you strictly use this as a movement speed increase while in <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=45528/ghost-wolf">Ghost Wolf</a> it is the best talent in this row if you do not need any crowd control options.  There are fringe scenarios where you can sit in <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=45528/ghost-wolf">Ghost Wolf</a> for 4 seconds (or less) to get some nice damage reduction.</p><h3><h2 dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Earthgrab Totem</h2></h3><p>Restoration is the only spec to retain <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=51485/earthgrab-totem"><b>Earthgrab Totem</b></a> as a talent.  In any encounter where rooting something is important look to this talent as a root + slow combination.</p><h3><h2 dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Static Charge</h2></h3><p><a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=192058/capacitor-totem"><b>Capacitor Totem</b></a> is now baseline with a minute cooldown.  Static Charge presents the possibility of lowering this cooldown to 40 seconds if four or more targets are stunned from a cast of <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=192058/capacitor-totem"><b>Capacitor Totem</b></a>.  This can be quite helpful in Mythic+ where you are chain pulling trash packs that need to be stunned.</p><h3><h2 dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Ancestral Vigor</h2></h3><p>A strong passive that adds a flat 10% health increase whenever one of our direct healing spells heals a target.  It is important to note that all bounces of <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=1064/chain-heal"><b>Chain Heal</b></a> apply <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=207401/ancestral-vigor"><b>Ancestral Vigor</b></a>. This is the default talent choice for this tier.</p><h3><h2 dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Earthen Wall Totem</h2></h3><p>A very efficient absorb that is useful for dealing with ticking raid damage. This is the only option from this tier that appears on meters, so expect to see it on a good amount of logs, even when it isn’t optimal.</p><h3><h2 dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Ancestral Protection Totem</h2></h3><p>This talent has 2 main uses: A raidwide application of <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=207401/ancestral-vigor"><b>Ancestral Vigor</b></a> on a long cooldown for high damage phases and as a way to sacrifice raiders to avoid difficult mechanics.  Finding uses for this can be tricky but when used properly it can be make or break when it comes to killing a boss.</p><h3><h2 dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Nature’s Guardian</h2></h3><p><a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=30884/natures-guardian"><b>Nature’s Guardian</b></a> provides us with a way of healing up after we receive damage that sets our health  below a certain threshold. The way this works is if any hit were to reduce your current health below 35% of you maximum health, you will heal for up to 20% of your maximum health.  I say up to because it is important to note that this heal happens <b>before</b> the damage event.  This means that if you are above 80% health and an ability brings you below 35% health, you will not heal for the full 20% health but rather the difference between your current life when you take the hit of damage and full health.  This ability can also save you from dying because the heal happens before the damage event brings your health to 0 or below. This is a contender with <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=192088/graceful-spirit"><b>Graceful Spirit</b></a> for the default talent choice in this row.</p><h3><h2 dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Graceful Spirit</h2></h3><p>The main benefit of <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=192088/graceful-spirit"><b>Graceful Spirit</b></a> is the 60 second cooldown reduction on <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=79206/spiritwalkers-grace"><b>Spiritwalker’s Grace</b></a>.  This allows <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=79206/spiritwalkers-grace"><b>Spiritwalker’s Grace</b></a> to be used twice as often while also increasing your movement speed while the buff is active.  Having high mobility is important on some encounters and the ability to continue healing while moving is unbelievably strong.  This is a contender with <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=30884/natures-guardian"><b>Nature’s Guardian</b></a> for the default talent choice in this row.</p><h3><h2 dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Wind Rush Totem</h2></h3><p><a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=192077/wind-rush-totem"><b>Wind Rush Totem</b></a> is a small radius totem that increases the movement speed of all allies nearby for a few seconds.  It is important to note that this buff can be refreshed by passing by the totem over it’s duration effectively increasing the uptime of the movement speed increase to 20 seconds.</p><h3><h2 dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Flash Flood</h2></h3><p><a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=280614/flash-flood"><b>Flash Flood</b></a> is a new talent in BFA that provides a cast speed reduction on your next heal after consuming a stack of <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=51564/tidal-waves"><b>Tidal Waves</b></a>.  It is important to note that this cast speed reduction can be used on any healing spell.  With proper weaving this can enable <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=1064/chain-heal"><b>Chain Heal</b></a> / <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=8004/healing-surge"><b>Healing Surge</b></a> rotations where you gain <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=51564/tidal-waves"><b>Tidal Waves</b></a> with <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=1064/chain-heal"><b>Chain Heal</b></a> and spend them on <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=8004/healing-surge"><b>Healing Surge</b></a> while gaining <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=280614/flash-flood"><b>Flash Flood</b></a> for your next <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=1064/chain-heal"><b>Chain Heal</b></a> cast.  <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=280614/flash-flood"><b>Flash Flood</b></a> stacks with the cast speed reduction of <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=51564/tidal-waves"><b>Tidal Waves</b></a> when casting <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=77472/healing-wave"><b>Healing Wave</b></a>.</p><h3><h2 dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Downpour</h2></h3><p><a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=207778/downpour"><b>Downpour</b></a> is a new talent that is very similar to our Legion Artifact ability <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=278082/gift-of-the-queen"><b>Gift of the Queen</b></a>.  It is a ground targeted heal that heals up to 6 allies within the area.  It is important to note that this ability will increase in cooldown if it does any effective healing.  This can be a curse if you use <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=207778/downpour"><b>Downpour</b></a> but someone only needs a few points of healing and you are punished with mostly overhealing but you also get the 5 seconds of added cooldown.  This is a very mana intensive talent as <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=280614/flash-flood"><b>Flash Flood</b></a> is free and <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=157153/cloudburst-totem"><b>Cloudburst Totem</b></a> costs almost nothing.</p><h3><h2 dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Cloudburst Totem</h2></h3><p>This talent has a great synergy with <b><a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=108283/echo-of-the-elements">Echo of the Elements</a> </b>giving it two charges which provides more flexibility in terms of timing your totem casts. While predominantly used to heal multiple people for a small amount each in raids, you will likely want to detonate it on 1 or 2 targets in Mythic+ for a larger heal.  It is important to note that <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=157153/cloudburst-totem"><b>Cloudburst Totem</b></a> replaces <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=5394/healing-stream-totem"><b>Healing Stream Totem</b></a> but costs less mana.  Read our <a href="http://ancestralguidance.com/cbt">Cloudburst Guide</a> on how to get the most out of this talent</p><h3><h2 dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">High Tide</h2></h3><p>Useful for any amount of raid damage, sustained or burst. Is the default talent for the tier as it strengthens one of our core spells by a good amount, allowing us to deal with all types of damage patterns.  Mana "consumed" while innervate is active will work towards your next proc.</p><h3><h2 dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Wellspring</h2></h3><p>Allows for large bursts of healing. This allows for a slightly more spread healing than <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=1064/chain-heal"><b>Chain Heal</b></a>, at the cost of sustained AoE healing from <a href="http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=157154/high-tide"><b>High Tide</b></a> and burst healing from <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=114052"><b>Ascendance</b></a>.</p><h3><h2 dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Ascendance<br></h2></h3><p>This talent hurts your sustained AoE healing in exchange for allowing you to have massive bursts in throughput on 3 minute intervals. The main downfall of this talent is its short range (20 yards) as well as increasing your output by 100% but divided evenly among all nearby allies whether they are injured or not.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 19, 2020</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/tag/general/">General</a></li></ul><div class="post__bio bio"><img class="bio__avatar" src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/website/AEPblackwater-1024x576.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="niseko"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/" class="invert" rel="author">niseko</a></h3><p>I am the Author, call me Arthur.</p></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/maximizing-cloudburst-totem/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Maximizing Cloudburst Totem</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/maximizing-cloudburst-totem/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Maximizing Cloudburst Totem </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2017-12-21T16:50" class="feed__date">December 21, 2017</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/standard-talent-builds/" class="invert">Standard Talent Builds</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Footer Section</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
