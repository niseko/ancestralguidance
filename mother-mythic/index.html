Heroic Guide Mythic difficulty of MOTHER adds no new abilities, but significantly changes two existing mechanics. The first you will encounter is the new types of Embodiments of Corruption that spawn whenever a tank or healer crosses the Defense Grid. These new adds have a few mechanics to watch out for. Firstly, the tank add, Resistant Bacterium, empowers all other nearby Embodiments of Corruption when it casts Bacterial Outbreak. When healers cross the Defense Grid, a Viral Contagion will spawn. Viral Contagions cast Endemic Virus which does significant damage over time to the recipient and is dispellable. When dispelled or when Endemic Virus expires, it triggers and outbreak of Spreading Epidemic which causes all allies within 10 yards to be afflicted by a significant damage over time effect. If any Viral Contagion's get their Endemic Virus casts off, ensure that your raid members afflicted by the virus move away from other raid members before you dispel them. Viral Contagions can be stun locked to ensure they never get a cast of Endemic Virus off. The second mechanic that has changes is MOTHER's Uldir Defense Beams. Instead of alternating between horizontal and vertical beams, both sets of beams happen at the same time. This effectively gives you only one safe spot to stand. Prioritize dodging the vertical beams first, then the horizontal beams as the vertical beams pass through the room first, then the horizontal beams finish coming down from the ceiling.

narrow the entry ways are.  <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1064/chain-heal">Chain Heal</a> on the other hand will pass through the barriers.  You can consider using <a

href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1064/chain-heal">Chain Heal</a> to do large sustained healing.</li><li>You are able to use ground targeted abilities through the <a
