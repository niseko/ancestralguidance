There are 3 main sources of damage: Frost Mark and Toxic Brand will ramp up over time and deal increasing ticking damage, and Unstable Mixture will deal damage when a person removes their stacks of either Frost Mark or Toxic Brand. To clear your stacks, you simply need to take the opposite form of damage (Frost players take Venom damage, and vice versa). This fight doesn’t really change much from Heroic aside from the numbers being much higher, however keeping the stacks of Frost Mark and Toxic Brand low will reduce the amount of damage your raid will take dramatically, so it’s recommended to clear your stacks around 4-5 so long as your raid is healthy. As the fight becomes more intense look to help your teammates who have Overflowing Chill or Overflowing Venom as they will need help soaking the damage. Lastly, the boss will always fire Overwhelming Barrage in the same order every time, so the tanks can face the boss towards the entrance of the room for the first Overwhelming Barrage, then towards the far (back) side of the room for the next, alternating between each Barrage so the raid takes less Unstable Mixture damage during the Overwhelming Barrage casts. This is our ‘standard’ talent build that we recommend, and nothing out of the ordinary changes in this fight so the standard build is great here.
