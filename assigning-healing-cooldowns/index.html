The most flexible of our cooldowns is easily <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=108281/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ancestral Guidance</a> (AG). On a two minute cooldown, it essentially replicates 60% of the healing you do and spreads it evenly across three targets. This healing feeds into <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=157153/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cloudburst totem</a> and ancestral guidance will then replicate the detonation healing of Cloudburst. Paired with <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=144258/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Velen’s Future Sight</a>, you gain the 15% healing increase, and even more double dipping since Cloudburst Totem will “store” healing done by Velen’s as well creating an even larger burst of healing that <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=108281/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AG </a>can provide if used properly. Ideally you want to pair AG with larger healing per cast spells like <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=73920/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Healing Rain</a>, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=207778/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gift of the Queen</a>, and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=1064/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chain Heal</a>.</p><p>If talented into <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=114052" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ascendance</a>, it is typically best to save <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=108281" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AG</a> for Ascendance and pair the two together. Ascendance works very similar to AG except it replicates 100% of the healing you do and spreads it evenly to everyone in range. Ancestral Guidance also replicates the healing done by Ascendance, but Ascendance does not replicate healing done by AG. The healing that AG replicates off Ascendance is done with the total amount healed by the Ascendance replication. Therefore, when using AG with Ascendance, AG not only replicates 60% of the healing you did but also 60% of the healing done by your Ascendance. This doubles the effectiveness of AG overall allowing it to heal up to 6 unique targets for 20% of a cast. Since these two cooldowns synergize so well together, you will want to use them during a window of 10 seconds of intense healing while having a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=157153" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cloudburst totem</a> prepared to capture the feeding from both the AG and Ascendance while also detonating in the AG window. For maximum effectiveness, use Ascendance just after dropping CBT, then AG 6 sec later.</p><p><a style="font-size: 15px; background-color: #dddddd;" href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=108280/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Healing Tide Totem</a> is our standalone best cooldown. With the trait <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=207362/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cumulative Upkeep</a>, the value of haste increases while <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=108280/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Healing Tide Totem</a> is active (this is where trolls will want to use their racial ability <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=26297/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">berserking</a>). While Cumulative Upkeep caps at 70%, baseline haste values you will only get 6 ticks out of Healing Tide Totem (a 50% increase to the final tick). With at least 17% haste (rounding up to be safe), you will gain full effectiveness out of Cumulative Upkeep (although anything below 33.33% haste will only provide a partial tick for Healing Tide Totem). If available, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=144258/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Velen’s Future Sight</a> also pairs well with Healing Tide Totem since totems benefit from the 15% healing increase as well as the overheal protection.</p><p><a style="font-size: 15px; background-color: #dddddd;" href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=98008" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spirit Link Totem</a> (SLT) is arguably the most powerful raid cooldown in the game. Health re-balancing by percentage allows to stabilise the raid at the same level while also providing a small damage reduction. SLT can be used to heal off raid-wide absorbs (such as on Sisters of the Moon from ToS) by having multiple people at a health deficit while having the majority of the group at high or full health. This creates a differential the totem tries to correct, but since the people that are low hp do not actually get their health increased (the healing is absorbed), the totem will keep trying to re-balance thus removing the absorb on the low health targets allowing them to quickly be healed. Something that I have picked up during my time raiding with a Mistweaver is trying to pair Spirit Link Totem with their <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=115310" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Revival</a> the majority of the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=115310" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Revival</a>’s healing is in the burst and SLT can prevent overhealing raid wide if everyone is at a health deficit.</p><p>Taking everything into consideration, try to line up <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=108281/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AG</a> with periods of medium damage with a big burst (<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=157153/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBT</a> to cover the burst), <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=108280/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Healing Tide Totem</a> when there is large raidwide damage, and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=98008" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spirit Link</a> to reduce damage taken while increasing overall survivability.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 19, 2020</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/tag/general/">General</a></li></ul><div class="post__bio bio"><img class="bio__avatar" src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/website/AEPblackwater-1024x576.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="niseko"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/" class="invert" rel="author">niseko</a></h3><p>I am the Author, call me Arthur.</p></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/standard-talent-builds/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Standard Talent Builds</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/stats-and-where-to-find-them/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Stats and Where to Find Them </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Footer Section</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
