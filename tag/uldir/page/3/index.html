Most of the fight you will be fighting Zul along with some forces of blood, none of which do anything significant. The main mechanics to be concerned with as a healer are Pool of Darkness, Dark Revelation, and Shadow Barrage. Pool of Darkness causes a shadowy circle to appear somewhere on Zul's platform. If no one is standing in this pool, it will inflict damage to everyone within 45 yards, it is advised to soak these instead of trying to run over 45 yards away from these as they spawn quite frequently. While stood in a Pool of Darkness, the pool inflicts moderate damage every 2 seconds and healing this person is a priority as letting them die means risking large raid wide damage. Dark Revelation is Zul's second raid wide damaging ability. Zul first picks two targets and afflicts them with Dark Revelation, after 10 seconds, the Dark Revelation expires dealing large damage raid wide to all players. This damage is reduced the further the player with Dark Revelation is from the raid members and in addition to this, minions of Zul spawn from the location that Dark Revelation expired. These minions of Zul are small shadow fiends that will rush at random raid members, fearing them if the minions get too close - you can instantly kill these adds by casting Purge on them to remove their Bound by Shadow buff. The last of Zul's abilities is Shadow Barrage which is a single target nuke he will spam&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/zul-heroic/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/website/AEPblackwater-1024x576.jpg" loading="lazy" class="post__author-thumb" alt="niseko"> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/" class="feed__author invert">niseko</a> <time datetime="2018-09-03T23:29" class="feed__date">September 3, 2018</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/vectis-heroic/" class="invert">Vectis Heroic</a></h2></header><div class="feed__image"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/vectis-heroic/"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/36/vectis.jpg" srcset="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/36/responsive/vectis-xs.jpg 300w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/36/responsive/vectis-sm.jpg 480w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/36/responsive/vectis-md.jpg 768w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/36/responsive/vectis-lg.jpg 1024w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/36/responsive/vectis-xl.jpg 1360w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/36/responsive/vectis-2xl.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" loading="lazy" height="804" width="1351" alt=""></a></div><div class="wrapper"><p>Mythic GuideThis guide is for the Heroic version of the fight and explains the basics.

Mythic Guide Vectis is a cyclic two phase fight that has one main mechanic that is applied at the start of the fight called Omega Vector. Omega vector is a debuff that deals shadow damage over time and upon expiration will jump to the closest ally, that, when it jumps, leaves a stack of Lingering Infection, which increases nature damage taken by 5% per stack. Phase 1 of the fight happens when Vectis is attackable. During this time he casts Contagion which deals nature damage to all players. Due to the nature of Omega Vector and Lingering Infection, the impact of this ability increases over the course of the fight. Vectis will also cast Gestate on a random player dealing shadow damage to them as well as any players nearby and stuns the primary target for 5 seconds. After the stun wears off, a Plague Amalgam will spawn, which only cast one ability, Immunosuppression. Immunosuppression debuffs every raid member with a significant healing absorb that stacks if it isn't removed before the next cast. Dealing with Immunosuppression is important to avoid a raid member having a large healing absorb when they are in danger of dying, use large healing cooldowns when Immunosuppression lines up with Contagion. In Phase 2, Vectis becomes untargetable and becomes a pool of blood. Any players who come in contact with the pool of blood will gain a stack of Lingering Infection. During this time, Vectis will cast Blood Geyser which are beams of blood that shoot out from the blood pool and deal shadow damage upon impact with any players. These Blood Geysers&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/vectis-heroic/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/website/AEPblackwater-1024x576.jpg" loading="lazy" class="post__author-thumb" alt="niseko"> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/" class="feed__author invert">niseko</a> <time datetime="2018-09-03T23:28" class="feed__date">September 3, 2018</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/zekvoz-heroic/" class="invert">Zek&#x27;voz Heroic</a></h2></header><div class="feed__image"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/zekvoz-heroic/"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/35/zekvox.jpg" srcset="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/35/responsive/zekvox-xs.jpg 300w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/35/responsive/zekvox-sm.jpg 480w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/35/responsive/zekvox-md.jpg 768w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/35/responsive/zekvox-lg.jpg 1024w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/35/responsive/zekvox-xl.jpg 1360w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/35/responsive/zekvox-2xl.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" loading="lazy" height="804" width="1351" alt=""></a></div><div class="wrapper"><p>Mythic GuideThis guide is for the Heroic version of the fight and explains the basics.

There are a few mechanics that are present in all phases of the fight. Titan Spark deals damage to several raid members in quick succession, the second mechanic is Surging Darkness which creates rings of darkness that deal large damage if players caught inside of them when they explode and anyone in the safe areas of the rings will take a small amount of damage. The last mechanic is the tank mechanic, Might of the Void. When a tank has two stacks of Void Lash, they will be immune to healing, so don't waste casts into them. In the first phase, abilities of C'thun are able to be used by Zek'voz. In this phase, a projection of C'thun will cast Eye Beam on raid members, the player targeted by Eye Beam must move it out of the raid since it will chain to nearby allies and deal increased damage for every jump. The initial damage of this is already insanely high, and after one to two chains it will almost surely kill anyone else it chains to. Zek'voz will also spawn Silithid Warriors that fixate on random raid members. Use Earthbind and Capacitor Totem to prevent these adds from attacking raid members. Upon reaching 65%, Zek'voz will channel a new titan disc, this one being Yogg-Saron. Eye Beam is replaced by Roiling Deceit and Silithid Warriors are replaced by Nerubian Voidweavers. Roiling Deceit targets 3 raid members and deals a high amount of damage over time to players afflicted, at the end of&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/zekvoz-heroic/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/website/AEPblackwater-1024x576.jpg" loading="lazy" class="post__author-thumb" alt="niseko"> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/" class="feed__author invert">niseko</a> <time datetime="2018-09-03T23:27" class="feed__date">September 3, 2018</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/fetid-devourer-heroic/" class="invert">Fetid Devourer Heroic</a></h2></header><div class="feed__image"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/fetid-devourer-heroic/"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/34/fetid.jpg" srcset="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/34/responsive/fetid-xs.jpg 300w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/34/responsive/fetid-sm.jpg 480w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/34/responsive/fetid-md.jpg 768w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/34/responsive/fetid-lg.jpg 1024w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/34/responsive/fetid-xl.jpg 1360w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/34/responsive/fetid-2xl.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" loading="lazy" height="804" width="1351" alt=""></a></div><div class="wrapper"><p>Mythic GuideThis guide is for the Heroic version of the fight and explains the basics.

The main mechanics on the fight are dealing with the massive amount of damage tanks are taking, as well as healing players targeted by Malodorous Miasma which turns into Putrid Paroxysm. Throughout the fight Fetid Devourer will cast Shockwave Stomp, knocking back all players and dealing damage to your entire raid, try to position yourself so you get knocked into a wall so you have less downtime on healing priority targets. When Fetid Devourer's energy reaches 100, it will cast Rotting Regurgitation which is a large endless cone that deals large amounts of damage and will apply a stack of Malodorous Miasma to anyone hit by it. Avoid getting hit by Rotting Regurgitation at all costs, but if you are going to be hit by it, use Astral Shift to reduce the upfront damage. When Fetid Devourer hits 50% health remaining, it gains Fetid Frenzy which increases its damage dealt by 25% and damage received by 50% - this is likely when you will use Bloodlust / Heroism. Be prepared to start spam healing tanks more often in this part of the fight as well as dealing with larger hits raidwide on Shockwave Stomp and Malodorous Miasma. This talent setup provides us with the most single target healing possible while also bringing good burst AoE heals in the form of Wellspring. Since tanks are the primary targets of damage taken, Earth Shield is recommended as the majority of the fight will be spent healing tanks or other priority targets.HEALING TIPSRotate through healing cooldowns after each Shockwave&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/fetid-devourer-heroic/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/website/AEPblackwater-1024x576.jpg" loading="lazy" class="post__author-thumb" alt="niseko"> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/" class="feed__author invert">niseko</a> <time datetime="2018-09-03T23:26" class="feed__date">September 3, 2018</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/mother-heroic/" class="invert">MOTHER Heroic</a></h2></header><div class="feed__image"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/mother-heroic/"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/33/mother.jpg" srcset="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/33/responsive/mother-xs.jpg 300w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/33/responsive/mother-sm.jpg 480w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/33/responsive/mother-md.jpg 768w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/33/responsive/mother-lg.jpg 1024w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/33/responsive/mother-xl.jpg 1360w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/33/responsive/mother-2xl.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" loading="lazy" height="804" width="1351" alt=""></a></div><div class="wrapper"><p>Mythic GuideThis guide is for the Heroic version of the fight and explains the basics.

The encounter area is made up of three rooms separated by a Defense Grid, and passing through them inflicts raid wide damage while spawning an Remnant of Corruption after 3 seconds. These Remnants cast Clinging Corruption that must be interrupted, if they are not, be prepared to use a large healing cooldown. While in the first room MOTHER has restricted access to her abilities. The first set of abilities MOTHER will always use in combination with each other, Wind Tunnel creates a massive wind effect that pushes players to one side of the room chosen seemingly randomly. At the same time, Purifying Flames will activate on the side of the room that the Wind Tunnel is pushing players towards. Standing in Purifying Flames deals large amounts of damage. Run against the Wind Tunnel to avoid taking this damage. MOTHER will occasionally cast Cleansing Purge while Wind Tunnel is active. When MOTHER is moved into the second room, she gains the ability to activate Uldir Defensive Beam. This causes lasers to move across the entire room in one of two patterns: Either the beams are vertical beams and come from the walls and have a small gap for players to avoid them, or the beams are horizontal beams that descend from the ceiling; In the latter case, safe spaces will glow on the floor in a line where there is no laser present. In either case, avoid taking damage from the lasers as you will likely die if you do not avoid them.
