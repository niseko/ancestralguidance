class="wrapper"><p>Fight MechanicsOrgozoa is the fifth boss in The Eternal Palace, and is another 2 phase encounter. This fight is also similar to heroic, the major change is Arcing Current, which causes players with Incubation Fluid to spread it to other nearby players, so they will need to get away from the group. The first minute of this fight has almost no damage, so healers should be adding in as much damage as possible during this time. Tanks will still take a very large amount of damage if they do not have any Desensitizing Sting stacks, so if they are about to swap they need to have some sort of active mitigation. This is another fight where 3 tanking can make the fight easier, as one tank solely focuses on grabbing the adds and stacking them together while the other two tanks focus on the boss. Players should find safe areas to stand during Dribbling Ichor to avoid taking a large amount of damage. There are times when Amniotic Splatter soaks overlap with Dribbling Ichor, so it may be smart to use an immunity of some sort to soak the Amniotic Splatter. Players with Incubation Fluid will need to spread out on every Arcing Current cast to avoid chaining Incubation Fluid to the entire raid. While the Zoatroids are alive, they will cast Pervasive Shock, inflicting a good amount of AoE damage to the raid; this on top of the Incubation Fluid DoT will force healers to chain healing CD’s during the later parts of each phase. Once the boss phases at 40% all players lose their Incubation Fluid debuffs and the intermission begins; you have enough time to use no movement speed increases and walk down the ramp before the cast needs to be kicked, so you should play it safe and avoid getting&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/orgozoa/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/website/AEPblackwater-1024x576.jpg" loading="lazy" class="post__author-thumb" alt="niseko"> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/" class="feed__author invert">niseko</a> <time datetime="2019-09-16T20:03" class="feed__date">September 16, 2019</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/lady-ashvane/" class="invert">Lady Ashvane</a></h2></header><div class="feed__image"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/lady-ashvane/"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/64/AEPashvane.jpg" srcset="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/64/responsive/AEPashvane-xs.jpg 300w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/64/responsive/AEPashvane-sm.jpg 480w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/64/responsive/AEPashvane-md.jpg 768w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/64/responsive/AEPashvane-lg.jpg 1024w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/64/responsive/AEPashvane-xl.jpg 1360w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/64/responsive/AEPashvane-2xl.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" loading="lazy" height="720" width="1280" alt=""></a></div><div class="wrapper"><p>Fight MechanicsLady Ashvane is the fourth boss in The Eternal Palace, and is the first real “wall” of the instance. It is a 2 phase encounter that rotates between the phases (1-2-1-2, etc). There is a tight dps check on this fight so most guilds opt to use only 3 healers to ensure they will have enough damage to kill the boss before the boss casts his third Hardened Carapace. This boss will require excellent CD timings for both healers and DPS, as you want to maximize the amount of damage you’re dealing during the burn phases. The most common strategy for this encounter is to use a third tank as a ‘sacrificial lamb’ to soak a large majority of the Rippling Wave bubbles. Doing this will lower the raid damage taken by a very large amount, making it much easier to 3 heal. Throughout the fight 3 players will get affected by Briny Bubble, and should stack on top of each other outside of the group so they can get cleaved down quickly; these players will require extra healing while they’re inside the bubble (it is worth noting you are able to immune the bubbles to dodge the mechanic). These sometimes overlap with Upsurge, which can very easily kill players who have taken other sources of damage. Coral Growths will also spawn throughout the encounter, and tanks should try to position the boss in such a way that it won’t be right on top of the Coral Growths, otherwise it will be very hard to soak the Rippling Waves that spawn from it. The third tank should aim to soak every Rippling Wave possible while the boss has an active Hardened Carapace, otherwise it will replenish the Hardened Carapace, probably resulting in a wipe.

This fight is arguably the easiest of the first 3 bosses as it is very similar to heroic and the only added mechanic is very easy to deal with. Every ~18 seconds the raid will take a heavy burst of damage from Unshackled Power, which is the primary form of damage in this fight. On Mythic, one additional add is spawned during the intermissions, so you will need to split your raid in half once it is time for the Intermission. Similar to Heroic, healers will need to dispel players with Arcane Bomb once the player is in a safe location. Everyone should aim to dodge the tornadoes spawned by Arcanado Burst as it is completely avoidable damage. During the Intermissions the tank can pull the Stormwraith towards the edge of the Ancient Tempest so Gale Buffet wont knock you out of the circle. Alternatively, you can have your back up against the entrance stairs so you are instead knocked into them and avoid being displaced by the knockback. DPS and tanks should rotate kicks on the Stormling’s Chain Lightnings to avoid extra damage. This fairly ‘standard’ talent setup is great for this boss, especially because you’ll be splitting your raid in half, meaning you would be unable to make great use of Wellspring and Ascendance throughout the entire encounter. Wind Rush Totem can be used at the start of intermission to help your group move through the Squall Traps a bit easier. Spouting Spirits and Overflowing Shores will provide a large amount of healing, especially if you can get the majority of the raid to stack up when you use your Spirit Link.

It should be noted, you cannot do normal pre-fight things such as eat food while underwater unless you use the Barnacle-Encrusted Gem so try to remember to get all of your buffs before you go underwater. The majority of the damage will come from Toxic Spine and being too close to other players via Bioelectric Feelers. There is one new addition to the fight on Mythic which is Piercing Barb, which will inflict 1.3million damage split between all players hit. If a player with an immunity gets this ability it is best that they get away from all other players and solo it as it will drastically reduce the amount of damage taken. Alternatively, you can have raid members help soak the Piercing Barb to split the damage done. Like Heroic, this boss has 3 platforms, however it is not required that you visit all 3 platforms to kill the boss Each Platform has 2 Shimmerskin Pufferfish which will explode into a Bioluminescent Cloud when killed, and players will need to swim into the cloud to remove Darkest Depths. Ground-placed spells and abilities are a bit of a hassle to use on this boss, so generally you want to avoid them if you can. I’d recommend Ancestral Vigor because of this, while otherwise using the 'standard' talent build. Spouting Spirits does still work underwater, and has a y-axis equal to roughly the diameter of the totem (picture the animation as a giant bubble). Having at least one Overflowing Shores may be useful, however, it's sometimes difficult to make use of Healing Rain on this encounter. Artifice of Time can actually see some use in this fight to help deal with Piercing Barb; having two healers use Artifice combined with external and personal DR’s, a person without an immunity is able to successfully solo Piercing Barb.

There are 3 main sources of damage: Frost Mark and Toxic Brand will ramp up over time and deal increasing ticking damage, and Unstable Mixture will deal damage when a person removes their stacks of either Frost Mark or Toxic Brand. To clear your stacks, you simply need to take the opposite form of damage (Frost players take Venom damage, and vice versa). This fight doesn’t really change much from Heroic aside from the numbers being much higher, however keeping the stacks of Frost Mark and Toxic Brand low will reduce the amount of damage your raid will take dramatically, so it’s recommended to clear your stacks around 4-5 so long as your raid is healthy. As the fight becomes more intense look to help your teammates who have Overflowing Chill or Overflowing Venom as they will need help soaking the damage. Lastly, the boss will always fire Overwhelming Barrage in the same order every time, so the tanks can face the boss towards the entrance of the room for the first Overwhelming Barrage, then towards the far (back) side of the room for the next, alternating between each Barrage so the raid takes less Unstable Mixture damage during the Overwhelming Barrage casts. This is our ‘standard’ talent build that we recommend, and nothing out of the ordinary changes in this fight so the standard build is great here. With the recent Wellspring buffs it is certainly viable to run Wellspring over High Tide, however there is no clear winner here, so pick what you’d prefer to play. Spouting Spirits and Overflowing Shores will provide a large amount of healing, however, it will be difficult to make use of Spouting Spirits full potential&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/abyssal-commander-sivara/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><nav class="wrapper pagination desc"><div class="pagination__item"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/tag/boss-guides/page/3/" class="readmore">Next </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></nav></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Footer Section</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
