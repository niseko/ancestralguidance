class="wrapper"><p>Fight MechanicsMaut is a 2 phase fight that with unique abilities in each phase. Occasionally Maut will cast Devour Magic which will drop a silencing pool on the ground whenever the debuff falls off the player. These will be important later on when the boss casts Stygian Annihilation as it prevents the damage from the ability. On Mythic, the Devour Magic pools serve an additional purpose, as they can dispel the Ancient Curse that happens twice in each Phase 1. Periodically, Maut will also cast Black Wings which will knock back any player within 40 yards of the cone. Ranged can dodge this ability completely if they stand away from the boss opposite of the melee group, as the boss will always target the melee with it. After the 2nd Ancient Curse or about the time the boss casts the 3rd Black Wings, the add tank should drag a few of the adds into the boss to transition the boss into Phase 2. When Phase 2 begins, Maut will run to the center of the platform and cast Obsidian Skin, along with a long channeled ability called Obsidian Shatter. Obsidian Skin will reflect 100% of the damage you deal back into you, which can be very deadly for some classes. Your raid also needs to do enough damage to drain Maut's mana such that he has 0 mana left before the Obsidian Shatter cast finishes, thus it's a balancing act of dealing enough damage to beat the Obsidian Shatter cast, but not enough to outright kill yourself with Obsidian Skin. Additionally, Maut will occasionally put Drain Essence on 2 friendlies, who will need dispelled as soon as possible. While this phase does require an immense amount of healing, tanks will be soaking Forbidden Mana orbs periodically, allowing healers to gain&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/maut/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/website/AEPblackwater-1024x576.jpg" loading="lazy" class="post__author-thumb" alt="niseko"> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/" class="feed__author invert">niseko</a> <time datetime="2020-04-12T00:40" class="feed__date">April 12, 2020</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/wrathion/" class="invert">Wrathion</a></h2></header><div class="feed__image"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/wrathion/"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/69/wrathion.jpg" srcset="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/69/responsive/wrathion-xs.jpg 300w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/69/responsive/wrathion-sm.jpg 480w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/69/responsive/wrathion-md.jpg 768w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/69/responsive/wrathion-lg.jpg 1024w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/69/responsive/wrathion-xl.jpg 1360w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/69/responsive/wrathion-2xl.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" loading="lazy" height="720" width="1280" alt=""></a></div><div class="wrapper"><p>Fight MechanicsWrathion is a 2 phase encounter that transitions between phase 1 and phase 2, separated by intermissions. On Mythic, players immediately start with Creeping Madness which will hinder the ability to move throughout the fight. You can safely stand still for most of Wrathion's abilities as a ranged, and even be far enough away so that Gale Blast will not affect you like it does the melee. Every so often he will cast Incineration on 3 random allies who need to run a bit away from the group to reduce the amount of damage you take. There are 2 Incineration casts per phase, and each phase is separated by about 3 minutes, so you can safely use raid-wide damage reductions like Spirit Link Totem on these abilities if you want. Occasionally the boss will cast Burning Cataclysm and you will need to move to the opposite side of the platform as his 'smoke cloud'. This is a great time to use Wind Rush Totem to allow the slower players to be able to reach the safe area in time. You will repeat these steps again before the boss transitions into his next phase. In Phase 2, three players will need to grab the Scales of Wrathion from under the boss and run through as many Crackling Shards as they can so the group can kill off as many as possible. Help kill some of the Crackling Shards that are far away from the boss so that the melee don't accidentally gain stacks from running back to Wrathion if he transitions back into Phase 1. A pretty standard talent setup is great for Wrathion, with the addition of Wind Rush Totem to help move your group during the intermissions. Earthen Wall Totem is quite good to place while everyone is&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/wrathion/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/website/AEPblackwater-1024x576.jpg" loading="lazy" class="post__author-thumb" alt="niseko"> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/" class="feed__author invert">niseko</a> <time datetime="2019-09-16T20:07" class="feed__date">September 16, 2019</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/queen-azshara/" class="invert">Queen Azshara</a></h2></header><div class="feed__image"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/queen-azshara/"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/68/AEPazshara.jpg" srcset="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/68/responsive/AEPazshara-xs.jpg 300w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/68/responsive/AEPazshara-sm.jpg 480w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/68/responsive/AEPazshara-md.jpg 768w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/68/responsive/AEPazshara-lg.jpg 1024w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/68/responsive/AEPazshara-xl.jpg 1360w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/68/responsive/AEPazshara-2xl.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" loading="lazy" height="720" width="1280" alt=""></a></div><div class="wrapper"><p>Fight MechanicsQueen Azshara is a four phase encounter that mostly deals with managing the power level of the Wards of Power around the room. In the first phase you are tasked with fighting Cyranus and Aethanel. These two mini bosses have mostly negligible mechanics from a healer perspective except for Cyranus's Charged Spear. During this phase you will also be tasked with killing Overzealous Hulks before they are able to drain the power of the Wards of Power. Azshara will also occasionally drain a Ward of Power at random around the room. To recharge these wards you can stand in them but you will gain a stack of Drained Soul. Avoid getting more than 5 or 6 stacks of Drained Soul if possible. Azshara will also occasionally cast Beckon which will always target 1 healer and 1 ranged damage dealer. In this phase, the beckon spawn point will always be near the middle of the room. Avoid being mind controlled by walking as far from the image of Azshara as possible (outside edge of the room) Azshara will also occasionally spawn Arcane Orb around the room that must be soaked fully or else they will deal heavy raid damage. Only one person needs to soak each orb. Lastly, Azshara will cast Divide and Conquer which will split the room in half on one of the two diagonals (front left to back right or front right to back left from the perspective of when you first zone in to the room). Once Cyranus and Aethanel are deafted, Queen Azshara will move into her first intermission. During this intermission you will be marked with two decrees and multiple arcane orb will spawn around the room. Simply obey the decrees you are given and make sure as a raid all the arcane orb are soaked.

Za'qul starts out only having a few abilities. Za'qul occasionally casts Tentacles which spawns a tentacle somewhere on the outside of the room then spawns 2 more (counter clockwise to the first spawn). These tentacles shoot out in a straight line across the circle from their spawn point and will knockback any players in the line as well as do heavy damage (generally lethal). Za'qul will also spawn 3 Horrific Summoners as long as at least 1 player is in the normal realm. The last ability Za'qul has is Dread. Dread causes 4 raid members to run in fear and deals heavy raid wide damage when dispelled. Upon reaching 85% health, Za'qul opens the Fear Realm and drags the entire raid into the Fear Realm. While in the Fear Realm, all players inside gain a stack of Hysteria every 15 seconds. Za'qul also will mark two raid members with Manifest Nightmares which deals heavy periodic damage over a few seconds and leaves a Nightmare Pool near the afflicted player's feet every tick. Upon expiration a Horrific Vision will spawn from each player. The last mechanic, Maddening Eruption will kill you if you are stood in it when it goes off. For 20 seconds after the Maddening Eruption goes off, Za'qul takes 30% more damage. When Za'qul reaches 70% health, he will open the Delirium Realm. This realm is mostly for DPS players as any player who enters the Delirium Realm will be hostile to all other players within the realm. As a healer, the only things to worry about is to not go into the Delirium Realm (don't stand in the orange eye balls of the floor), and dispel people who&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/zaqul/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/website/AEPblackwater-1024x576.jpg" loading="lazy" class="post__author-thumb" alt="niseko"> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/" class="feed__author invert">niseko</a> <time datetime="2019-09-16T20:05" class="feed__date">September 16, 2019</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/queens-court/" class="invert">Queen&#x27;s Court</a></h2></header><div class="feed__image"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/queens-court/"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/66/AEPqueen.jpg" srcset="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/66/responsive/AEPqueen-xs.jpg 300w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/66/responsive/AEPqueen-sm.jpg 480w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/66/responsive/AEPqueen-md.jpg 768w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/66/responsive/AEPqueen-lg.jpg 1024w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/66/responsive/AEPqueen-xl.jpg 1360w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/66/responsive/AEPqueen-2xl.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" loading="lazy" height="720" width="1280" alt=""></a></div><div class="wrapper"><p>Fight MechanicsThe Queen's Court is the sixth boss in The Eternal Palace. It is similar to Heroic with the added mechanic of Sphere of Influence on Mythic difficulty, causing you to kite both bosses around the room in a clockwise motion. Like heroic, the majority of the damage comes from Form Ranks and Potent Spark, making those overlaps very difficult to deal with. Tanks should always keep the bosses at least 21 yards apart due to Separation of Power, as any time they are too close will result in a huge damage loss, making the already tight enrage even harder. The raid will have to deal with several Decrees throughout the fight; it's important you know which decree is active so you can deal with each of them effectively. Silivaz will occasionally use Frenetic Charge at a player, which will deal heavy split damage, so the raid should help the player soak the damage unless Stand Alone is currently active. During the Frenetic Charge and Stand Alone overlap, you can use external damage reductions, immunities, or simply opt to sacrifice the player with Frenetic Charge to avoid a large amount of damage caused by Stand Alone. Silivaz will also cast Zealous Eruption, and you must make sure to be inside of the bubble as it does an incredible amount of damage and will almost certainly kill you. Again, this is dangerous while Stand Alone is active, so be weary of people around you. Pashmar occasionally targets players with Fanatical Verdict, which will deal a large amount of damage, so players should try to avoid soaking other forms of damage if possible. Make sure you aren't inside Violent Outburst when it is finished casting. Lastly Pashmar will summon Potent Sparks, which will slowly die on their own, and when killed will&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/queens-court/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><nav class="wrapper pagination desc"><div class="pagination__item"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/tag/boss-guides/page/4/" class="readmore">Previous</a></div><div class="pagination__item"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/tag/boss-guides/page/2/" class="readmore">Next </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></nav></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Footer Section</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
