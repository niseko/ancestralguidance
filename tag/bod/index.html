In Phase 1, you will be fighting Jaina on a boat where as a healer you are tasked with dispelling anyone who is afflicted by Grasp of Frost and Ring of Ice if people do not preposition themselves in the fire around the room. Try to avoid getting hit by Freezing Blast, take Avalanche out of the raid, and avoid getting hit by Bombard. When Jaina reaches 60% health remaining, she will transition into the first intermission where she causes the ship to crash into an iceberg and the fight continues by following her onto the iceberg. Jaina casts Howling Winds which restricts vision of her and will stop when interrupted. On Mythic difficulty, Jaina also summons 5 clones of herself that cast Howling Winds which need to be interrupted and killed before you can interrupt Jaina. Dodge the Blistering Tornadoes and Glacial Shards. Use Wind Rush Totem as you jump off the boat to increase the speed at which your raid runs and completes this phase to reduce the overall number of stacks of Chilling Touch applied. Once Jaina is interrupted, Phase 2 begins. The main mechanic of this phase is Chilling Touch. Chilling Touch stacks up over time dealing increased damage and applying an increasing slow. To remove stacks of Chilling Touch you will need to break open an Unexploded Ordnance. Around the room will be 3 Unexploded Ordnances that are encased in Refractive Ice reducing damage they take by 99%. You will want to break these open by dropping Broadside on them. Heal targets with Broadside as they will be taking a significant amount of added damage. When the Unexploded Ordnances are broken they will create an area that provides Warmth. After a few seconds these Ordnances&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/lady-jaina-proudmoore/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/website/AEPblackwater-1024x576.jpg" loading="lazy" class="post__author-thumb" alt="niseko"> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/" class="feed__author invert">niseko</a> <time datetime="2019-03-01T17:37" class="feed__date">March 1, 2019</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/stormwall-blockade/" class="invert">Stormwall Blockade</a></h2></header><div class="feed__image"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/stormwall-blockade/"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/57/Stormwall.jpg" srcset="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/57/responsive/Stormwall-xs.jpg 300w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/57/responsive/Stormwall-sm.jpg 480w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/57/responsive/Stormwall-md.jpg 768w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/57/responsive/Stormwall-lg.jpg 1024w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/57/responsive/Stormwall-xl.jpg 1360w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/57/responsive/Stormwall-2xl.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" loading="lazy" height="720" width="1280" alt=""></a></div><div class="wrapper"><p>Fight MechanicsStormwall Blockade is a two phase fight in which you start by fighting Sister Katherine and Brother Joseph. Regardless of which boat you start on, you will have to deal with both the Sister and the Brother, just in different orders. Sister Katherine has the following mechanics: Brother Joseph has the following mechanics: In Mythic difficulty, Spawns of Laminaria are present near the two boats and they will cast Sea Swell every 20 seconds. The easiest way to handle this is to have everyone create a stack point and "dip" into the Frozen Tidepools on the ground when Sea Swell is cast to prevent the entire boat from being covered by Frozen Tidepool. Once Sister Katherine and Brother Joseph are defeated, you are able to take Translocation Pedestals over to the docks to fight Laminaria. Laminaria will cast Sea Swell on a 20 sec timer which you will want to be stacked up as much as possible to leave as much of the platform clear. Laminaria will also cast Ire of the Deep which spawns an orb that must be soaked or the raid will suffer massive damage and pools of Frozen Tidepool will spawn around the platform. Lastly, Laminaria will debuff someone with Storm's Wail, this allows you to walk over Frozen Tidepools and clear them, but will spawn an Energized Storm add at the end of the debuff. Make sure you get this add out as far as possible to maximize the time you have to kill it. Tanks will also be afflicted by Kelp-Wrapped which is able to be magic dispelled. When dispelled it increases the damage taken of all nearby players and Energized Storms. Make sure to have one or two healers assigned to dispel the tanks when they call for it.

The main ways your raid will be taking damage is through Blast Off / Crash Down, and Mekkatorque's Sparkbots shooting their Spark Volley. When Mekkatorque is brought below 40% health and he has come down from the intermission he gains Hyperdrive which adds a new raidwide pulsing mechanic in the form of Hyperdrive Discharge. Other than these mechanics, dodge Buster Cannons, heal people who are targeted by Gigavolt Charge and the following Gigavolt Blasts. In addition, when Mekkatorque reaches 40% health remaining, you will need to dodge Sheep Shrapnel spawned from the exploding sheep. Periodically, Mekkatorque will cast Wormhole Generator which teleports everyone to one player's location. On Mythic, Mekkatorque will cause 3 people to be sent flying into the air and will polymorph 3 other people. Dispel the polymorphed players as quickly as possible as Wormhole Generator is usually cast right before a Blast Off / Crash Down combo. Throughout the fight if you are shrunk, you will need to enter a sparkbot and enter the shutdown codes provided to you by other shrunken raid members in their own sparkbots. You cannot see your own color, so help your other raid members to shut down the other sparkbots. In addition, when raid members are shrunk, one will become Enormous. Enormous players should move as little as possible to prevent Trample on normal sized players and to prevent Squishing plays who are Shrunk. Lastly, in Mythic when a Gigavolt Charge expires a Gigavolt Radiation Zone will appear beneath the feet of the player who had the Gigavolt Charge. These zones will disappear after 3 minutes and should be avoided at all costs.

Siegebreaker Roka casts Meteor Leap, make sure you soak this as a raid. Prelate Za'lan casts Seal of Purification at a DPS member, make sure you don't stand in this. Headhunter Gal'wana casts Grevious Axe at 3 random players on Mythic. These targets need to be topped as quickly as possible. During this, Rastakhan will cast Plague of Toads, Greater Serpent Totem, and Scorching Detonation. The toads and serpent totems should be avoided at all costs, and the Scorching Detonation you will want to use a healing cooldown for. Once Phase 2 begins you will want to position yourself on the edge of Bwonsomdi's Aura of Death to heal the tank who is currently tanking Bwonsomdi. Spread out for Plague of Fire. Dodge Plague of Toads. If you are the only shaman in your raid, use Tremor Totem on the first Zombie Dust Totem, and then skip the next, using it again on the third totem. Death's Door need to be placed where ever your raid leader decides. You can place them near the door to make the next Bwonsomdi phase easier by creating a barrier, or you can place one near the middle of the room to allow melee going down to remove their Deathly Withering if you are going for the non-cheese strategy. Once your barrier of Death's Doors or your single drop off point is created, drop all Death's Doors on a wall or in a corner for the rest of the fight. When King Rastakhan reaches 60% health remaining, Bwonsomdi will pull half the raid (closest raid members to him) into the death realm.

You are first tasked with fighting both the Aspect of Pa'ku and Gonk. When one of them is defeated, the Aspect of Kimbul joins the encounter. When the second Aspect is killed, Akunda's Aspect joins the fight. When all four are defeated, the encounter is over. When any of the four Aspect dies, a Cry of the Fallen is triggered dealing large amounts of raid damage, as well as a Loa's Wrath which increases the damage of all remaining active Aspects by 15%. This means Kimbul and Akunda will both spawn with 15% increased damage since they enter the fight after another Aspect is slain. Throughout the encounter, multiple Loa show up in spirit form and perform some sort of attack. The Loa have the following abilities: The Aspects themselves have a few notable abilities. Gonk's Aspect casts Crawling Hex which will hex multiple raid members and if they are dispelled near other players will cause the other players to be hexed. Pa'ku's Aspect casts Gift of the Wind which causes all bosses and minions in the room to gain movement speed and haste. This needs to be purged or dispelled as quickly as possible. Kimbul's Aspect casts a frontal cleave that leaves a large bleed on anyone hit, prioritize healing these targets. Akunda's Aspect casts Mind Wipe which causes a 30 second lockout on all abilities and spells unless dispelled. This is a magic debuff meaning it can only be dispelled by healers or priests with mass dispel. Since this encounter has strictly windows of burst damage and Bwonsomdi's Curse soaks bounces of Chain Heal, it is recommended that you either take Wellspring. Using Wellspring will help cover the more consistent raid damage from Kimbul's Wrath.
