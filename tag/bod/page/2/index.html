class="wrapper"><p>Fight MechanicsDuring phase 1 of Opulence you will be placed on either left or right hallway. If you are placed on the left hallway, you will have to deal with healing people who get Volatile Charge. If you are targeted with Volatile Charge, make sure it expires on you when you are at the side of the room, preferably where you entered rather than where you need to go. If you are on the right side, you will have to deal with Flames of Punishment. Stay behind the boss to avoid taking damage from Flames of Punishment. On either side, avoid being infront of the mini-boss when they cast Crush. Once a mini-boss has taken 10% of its health in damage, it will move to the next trapped room. The traps in the room follow this pattern: In the final room, the mini-bosses will pulse damage to raid members in the room with them, as well as their special abilities (Volatile Charge and Flames of Punishment) grow in size. As a Restoration Shaman you will be grabbing either the Amethyst or Sapphire gem. If you are grabbing Amethyst, you will want to heal everyone with Thief's Bane before it expires to prevent them from dying. Also when you reach phase 2 you will need to cover the entire raid with Shadow-Touched to prevent them from dying to Wail of Greed. On Mythic difficulty, DPS members will periodically be transferred between sides, 2 at a time. You don't have to worry about this as a healer. The other mythic change is the duration of Shadow-Touched and Tailwinds is much shorter on Mythic which means you'll need to reapply these buffs much more often. In Phase 2, you will actually be fighting Opulence. Heal raid members targeted by Liquid Gold, move out&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/opulence/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/website/AEPblackwater-1024x576.jpg" loading="lazy" class="post__author-thumb" alt="niseko"> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/" class="feed__author invert">niseko</a> <time datetime="2019-03-01T17:32" class="feed__date">March 1, 2019</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/jadefire-masters/" class="invert">Jadefire Masters</a></h2></header><div class="feed__image"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/jadefire-masters/"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/52/JFM.jpg" srcset="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/52/responsive/JFM-xs.jpg 300w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/52/responsive/JFM-sm.jpg 480w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/52/responsive/JFM-md.jpg 768w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/52/responsive/JFM-lg.jpg 1024w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/52/responsive/JFM-xl.jpg 1360w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/52/responsive/JFM-2xl.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" loading="lazy" height="720" width="1280" alt=""></a></div><div class="wrapper"><p>Fight MechanicsJadefire masters is relatively easy when it comes to the healing requirement it has. The only consistent raid damage is from the tank's Rising Flames stacks expire. Other than that, there are spikes of raidwide damage during each of the boss's special abilities. The first, Fire of the Mist causes three living bombs to spawn around the room shrouded in mist that explode every few seconds. You will likely want to use multiple raid cooldowns during this as your raid will be constantly moving from bomb to bomb with line of sight issues caused by the mist around each of the bombs. The second special ability is A Flash of Hostility which will spawn a maze made up of Ring of Peace. During this, there will be constant raid damage until the Barrier seperating the bosses from the raid is killed. You will want at least one healing cooldown while the raid is moving to the barrier. The final special ability is The Serpent and the Phoenix which the causes the bosses to turn into a dragon and a phoenix. There is constant AoE damage as long as the phoenix lives. Try to not step in Magma Traps as a shaman since we have no way to stop ourselves from dying to falling damage. Make sure you dispel Searing Embers before it expires as it will cause a large amount of raid damage. On mythic difficulty, when the monk boss casts Multi-Sided Strike, you will likely go up in the air and have to look at 5 monk spirits in the following order: Blue, Green, Red, Green, Blue. You could consider taking Ascendance over HT since this fight has no real sustained damage until the bosses reach 100 energy which is at the very end of the fight.

Depending on Faction you'll see different names for the same abilities and they'll be listed as Horde / Alliance. This is a fight filled with constant raidwide AoE damage while also having high tank damage. Every form of raidwide damage in this encounter is done in large chunks. The first of which is Grong's Ferocious Roar. Make sure you are standing near one other player when Grong casts Ferocious Roar to not get feared. In Mythic, the fear turns to a horrify which means Tremor Totem has no use. Next, after each Bestial Combo, Grong will cast Bestial Throw which deals raid damage that decreases with distance the throw is from the boss. If you are targeted by the throw, run away from your raid members so they don't get hit by the impact, but more importantly run away from Grong to reduce overall raid damage. Grong's final raid damage ability is Reverberating Slam which targets a melee and does damage in a large area around that melee player. More than likely, every melee player will be hit by this mechanic so they will need to be healed. After the slam, a Reverberating Echo will happen a few seconds later. Do not stand in the Reverberating Echo. Ranged players will be targeted by Megatomic Seeker Missles / Voodoo Blasts. Move quickly out of the fire on the ground caused by these mechanics. Lastly, when Grong reaches full energy or when triggered by using a Apetagonizer Core / Necrotic Core, he will cast Tantrum / Death Knell. For each 25 energy Grong has, he will deal a large amount of raid damage and leave a stack of Shattered / Death Touched. This causes your raid to always be taking a small amount of damage&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/grong/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/website/AEPblackwater-1024x576.jpg" loading="lazy" class="post__author-thumb" alt="niseko"> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/" class="feed__author invert">niseko</a> <time datetime="2019-03-01T17:30" class="feed__date">March 1, 2019</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/champion-of-the-light/" class="invert">Champion of the Light</a></h2></header><div class="feed__image"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/champion-of-the-light/"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/50/Champion.jpg" srcset="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/50/responsive/Champion-xs.jpg 300w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/50/responsive/Champion-sm.jpg 480w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/50/responsive/Champion-md.jpg 768w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/50/responsive/Champion-lg.jpg 1024w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/50/responsive/Champion-xl.jpg 1360w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/50/responsive/Champion-2xl.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" loading="lazy" height="720" width="1280" alt=""></a></div><div class="wrapper"><p>Fight MechanicsWhile Champion of the Light is the first encounter in Battle of Dazar'alor, there are a few key mechanics to look out for as a healer. There is raid wide damage every time the boss melees during Seal of Retribution. Use AoE healing spells frequently to combat this. Also the tank who is tanking the main boss will be taking increased damage over time from Sacred Blade, make sure to keep an eye on this tank as you are healing the raid. When Seal of Retribution ends and Seal of Reckoning begins the constant raid damage will cease. Any damage done to the boss from a target without Sacred Blade will cause the boss to gains stacks of Zealotry. When all the adds are defeated or when the boss reaches full energy, the boss will cast Judgement: Reckoning which you will want to use defensive cooldowns for. Lastly, the boss will periodically cast Wave of Light. Make sure to dispel anyone who is hit by the wave as it deals a large amount of damage over time. Once the boss hits 30% health, it will cast Avenging Wrath, increasing its damage by 30%. On mythic difficulty, the boss will also cast Prayer for the Fallen. During this cast any Disciple adds, and their ghosts will need to be interrupted, use Wind Shear to prevent them from healing the boss to full health. Also the Crusader adds will cast Divine Mallet which sends out a spiral of hammers in four directions that deal damage on contact with players. Due to the constant raid damage present during most off the encounter EWT and HT are recommended. You could drop CBT in favor of Downpour as they will perform similarly throughput wise, but CBT is one less global and slightly more efficient&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/champion-of-the-light/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><nav class="wrapper pagination desc"><div class="pagination__item"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/tag/bod/" class="readmore">Next </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></nav></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Footer Section</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
