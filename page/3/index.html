third boss in The Eternal Palace. It should be noted, you cannot do normal pre-fight things such as eat food while underwater unless you use the Barnacle-Encrusted Gem so try to remember to get all of your buffs before you go underwater. The majority of the damage will come from Toxic Spine and being too close to other players via Bioelectric Feelers. There is one new addition to the fight on Mythic which is Piercing Barb, which will inflict 1.3million damage split between all players hit. If a player with an immunity gets this ability it is best that they get away from all other players and solo it as it will drastically reduce the amount of damage taken. Alternatively, you can have raid members help soak the Piercing Barb to split the damage done. Like Heroic, this boss has 3 platforms, however it is not required that you visit all 3 platforms to kill the boss Each Platform has 2 Shimmerskin Pufferfish which will explode into a Bioluminescent Cloud when killed, and players will need to swim into the cloud to remove Darkest Depths. Ground-placed spells and abilities are a bit of a hassle to use on this boss, so generally you want to avoid them if you can. I’d recommend Ancestral Vigor because of this, while otherwise using the 'standard' talent build. Spouting Spirits does still work underwater, and has a y-axis equal to roughly the diameter of the totem (picture the animation as a giant bubble). Having at least one Overflowing Shores may be useful, however, it's sometimes difficult to make use of Healing Rain on this encounter. Artifice of Time can actually see some use in this fight to help deal with Piercing Barb; having two healers use Artifice combined with external and personal DR’s, a person without an immunity is able to successfully solo Piercing Barb.

There are 3 main sources of damage: Frost Mark and Toxic Brand will ramp up over time and deal increasing ticking damage, and Unstable Mixture will deal damage when a person removes their stacks of either Frost Mark or Toxic Brand. To clear your stacks, you simply need to take the opposite form of damage (Frost players take Venom damage, and vice versa). This fight doesn’t really change much from Heroic aside from the numbers being much higher, however keeping the stacks of Frost Mark and Toxic Brand low will reduce the amount of damage your raid will take dramatically, so it’s recommended to clear your stacks around 4-5 so long as your raid is healthy. As the fight becomes more intense look to help your teammates who have Overflowing Chill or Overflowing Venom as they will need help soaking the damage. Lastly, the boss will always fire Overwhelming Barrage in the same order every time, so the tanks can face the boss towards the entrance of the room for the first Overwhelming Barrage, then towards the far (back) side of the room for the next, alternating between each Barrage so the raid takes less Unstable Mixture damage during the Overwhelming Barrage casts. This is our ‘standard’ talent build that we recommend, and nothing out of the ordinary changes in this fight so the standard build is great here. With the recent Wellspring buffs it is certainly viable to run Wellspring over High Tide, however there is no clear winner here, so pick what you’d prefer to play. Spouting Spirits and Overflowing Shores will provide a large amount of healing, however, it will be difficult to make use of Spouting Spirits full potential&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/abyssal-commander-sivara/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/website/AEPblackwater-1024x576.jpg" loading="lazy" class="post__author-thumb" alt="niseko"> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/" class="feed__author invert">niseko</a> <time datetime="2019-06-25T23:35" class="feed__date">June 25, 2019</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/changes-in-82/" class="invert">Changes in 8.2</a></h2></header><div class="feed__image"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/changes-in-82/"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/59/I1KJGRFGVHMO1554940695570.jpg" srcset="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/59/responsive/I1KJGRFGVHMO1554940695570-xs.jpg 300w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/59/responsive/I1KJGRFGVHMO1554940695570-sm.jpg 480w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/59/responsive/I1KJGRFGVHMO1554940695570-md.jpg 768w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/59/responsive/I1KJGRFGVHMO1554940695570-lg.jpg 1024w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/59/responsive/I1KJGRFGVHMO1554940695570-xl.jpg 1360w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/59/responsive/I1KJGRFGVHMO1554940695570-2xl.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" loading="lazy" height="1350" width="2400" alt=""></a></div><div class="wrapper"><p>There is a lot of new content in 8.2, and it can be a lot to digest if you skimming through the various guides. So I’d like to cover some of the changes that are relevant to us to hopefully reduce the amount of info you may need to get through the patch. It’s worth noting, every crafted piece of gear no longer requires raid materials to make, however you will need to level up a ‘bench’ to upgrade your gear that requires some raid materials. Once you upgrade this, however, you are done completely on that character and never need the materials. Crafted gear is especially important because you can reroll them quite easily to obtain ideal stats + they all come with a socket (aside from Engineering, which is a 445 Azerite Helm). Leatherworking: You can create both Legs and Boots as the crafted gear, both of which have a socket on them and are very cheap to make aside from the new leather. Jewelcrafting: Similar to before, you get a new ring to make that has a socket on it. JC is very expensive though to unlock the 440 ring, so if you don’t want to throw a bunch of gold away into one piece of gear I’d consider something else, though this is arguably the best crafted piece to make. Alchemy: Same as before, you can get a pretty good Trinket fairly easily and it comes with a socket. It’s reliable, so it’s a safe profession to go with. Engineering: This is a great helm for “Battle Shaman” as it has IP on it, however the healing traits aren’t anything to get excited about (Turn of the Tide, and generic Engineering Traits).

These can be changed like Talents, and are meant to be changed with the content you are doing to make the most use out of them. With 8.2 right around the corner I thought I’d try to do a quick write-up of what we thought about the new Essences while testing them. I’ll give a quick description of what each Essence does, give some Pros and Cons for each, where and how easy they are to obtain, and try to explain situations where each of them would be useful. Keep in mind, this is from the PTR and things could still change (there were changes as recent as the day before writing this) and I’d imagine numbers tuning may not be final until the start of Mythic. Also, at the bottom I’ll try to list which Major/Minor powers from each Essence will be useful for us in most scenarios. This is NOT a BIS list. Consider the pros and cons of each essence to determine which to use for now. Major: (3 minute CD) Creates a time vortex around a player absorbing 331,288 damage and healing for 6 seconds. When this expires, the absorbed damage and healing is delivered over 10 seconds and the damage is reduced by 20%. Minor: Your heals have a very high chance to grant the target 281 Haste and 281 Speed for 8 seconds. Pro: This is very similar to the Void Stone trinket we have from Crucible of Storms, but absorbing more damage/healing.

In Phase 1, you will be fighting Jaina on a boat where as a healer you are tasked with dispelling anyone who is afflicted by Grasp of Frost and Ring of Ice if people do not preposition themselves in the fire around the room. Try to avoid getting hit by Freezing Blast, take Avalanche out of the raid, and avoid getting hit by Bombard. When Jaina reaches 60% health remaining, she will transition into the first intermission where she causes the ship to crash into an iceberg and the fight continues by following her onto the iceberg. Jaina casts Howling Winds which restricts vision of her and will stop when interrupted. On Mythic difficulty, Jaina also summons 5 clones of herself that cast Howling Winds which need to be interrupted and killed before you can interrupt Jaina. Dodge the Blistering Tornadoes and Glacial Shards. Use Wind Rush Totem as you jump off the boat to increase the speed at which your raid runs and completes this phase to reduce the overall number of stacks of Chilling Touch applied. Once Jaina is interrupted, Phase 2 begins. The main mechanic of this phase is Chilling Touch. Chilling Touch stacks up over time dealing increased damage and applying an increasing slow. To remove stacks of Chilling Touch you will need to break open an Unexploded Ordnance. Around the room will be 3 Unexploded Ordnances that are encased in Refractive Ice reducing damage they take by 99%. You will want to break these open by dropping Broadside on them. Heal targets with Broadside as they will be taking a significant amount of added damage. When the Unexploded Ordnances are broken they will create an area that provides Warmth.

Regardless of which boat you start on, you will have to deal with both the Sister and the Brother, just in different orders. Sister Katherine has the following mechanics: Brother Joseph has the following mechanics: In Mythic difficulty, Spawns of Laminaria are present near the two boats and they will cast Sea Swell every 20 seconds. The easiest way to handle this is to have everyone create a stack point and "dip" into the Frozen Tidepools on the ground when Sea Swell is cast to prevent the entire boat from being covered by Frozen Tidepool. Once Sister Katherine and Brother Joseph are defeated, you are able to take Translocation Pedestals over to the docks to fight Laminaria. Laminaria will cast Sea Swell on a 20 sec timer which you will want to be stacked up as much as possible to leave as much of the platform clear. Laminaria will also cast Ire of the Deep which spawns an orb that must be soaked or the raid will suffer massive damage and pools of Frozen Tidepool will spawn around the platform. Lastly, Laminaria will debuff someone with Storm's Wail, this allows you to walk over Frozen Tidepools and clear them, but will spawn an Energized Storm add at the end of the debuff. Make sure you get this add out as far as possible to maximize the time you have to kill it. Tanks will also be afflicted by Kelp-Wrapped which is able to be magic dispelled.

The main ways your raid will be taking damage is through Blast Off / Crash Down, and Mekkatorque's Sparkbots shooting their Spark Volley. When Mekkatorque is brought below 40% health and he has come down from the intermission he gains Hyperdrive which adds a new raidwide pulsing mechanic in the form of Hyperdrive Discharge. Other than these mechanics, dodge Buster Cannons, heal people who are targeted by Gigavolt Charge and the following Gigavolt Blasts. In addition, when Mekkatorque reaches 40% health remaining, you will need to dodge Sheep Shrapnel spawned from the exploding sheep. Periodically, Mekkatorque will cast Wormhole Generator which teleports everyone to one player's location. On Mythic, Mekkatorque will cause 3 people to be sent flying into the air and will polymorph 3 other people. Dispel the polymorphed players as quickly as possible as Wormhole Generator is usually cast right before a Blast Off / Crash Down combo. Throughout the fight if you are shrunk, you will need to enter a sparkbot and enter the shutdown codes provided to you by other shrunken raid members in their own sparkbots. You cannot see your own color, so help your other raid members to shut down the other sparkbots. In addition, when raid members are shrunk, one will become Enormous. Enormous players should move as little as possible to prevent Trample on normal sized players and to prevent Squishing plays who are Shrunk. Lastly, in Mythic when a Gigavolt Charge expires a Gigavolt Radiation Zone will appear beneath the feet of the player who had the Gigavolt Charge. These zones will disappear after 3 minutes and should be avoided at all costs. There's a few talents you can swap out on Mekkatorque depending on how you want to handle&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/high-tinker-mekkatorque/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/website/AEPblackwater-1024x576.jpg" loading="lazy" class="post__author-thumb" alt="niseko"> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/" class="feed__author invert">niseko</a> <time datetime="2019-03-01T17:35" class="feed__date">March 1, 2019</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/king-rastakhan/" class="invert">King Rastakhan</a></h2></header><div class="feed__image"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/king-rastakhan/"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/55/Rastakhan.jpg" srcset="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/55/responsive/Rastakhan-xs.jpg 300w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/55/responsive/Rastakhan-sm.jpg 480w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/55/responsive/Rastakhan-md.jpg 768w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/55/responsive/Rastakhan-lg.jpg 1024w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/55/responsive/Rastakhan-xl.jpg 1360w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/55/responsive/Rastakhan-2xl.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" loading="lazy" height="720" width="1280" alt=""></a></div><div class="wrapper"><p>Fight MechanicsKing Rastakhan is a four phase encounter that starts out with three adds that must be killed to actually fight Rastakhan. Siegebreaker Roka casts Meteor Leap, make sure you soak this as a raid. Prelate Za'lan casts Seal of Purification at a DPS member, make sure you don't stand in this. Headhunter Gal'wana casts Grevious Axe at 3 random players on Mythic. These targets need to be topped as quickly as possible. During this, Rastakhan will cast Plague of Toads, Greater Serpent Totem, and Scorching Detonation. The toads and serpent totems should be avoided at all costs, and the Scorching Detonation you will want to use a healing cooldown for. Once Phase 2 begins you will want to position yourself on the edge of Bwonsomdi's Aura of Death to heal the tank who is currently tanking Bwonsomdi. Spread out for Plague of Fire. Dodge Plague of Toads. If you are the only shaman in your raid, use Tremor Totem on the first Zombie Dust Totem, and then skip the next, using it again on the third totem. Death's Door need to be placed where ever your raid leader decides. You can place them near the door to make the next Bwonsomdi phase easier by creating a barrier, or you can place one near the middle of the room to allow melee going down to remove their Deathly Withering if you are going for the non-cheese strategy. Once your barrier of Death's Doors or your single drop off point is created, drop all Death's Doors on a wall or in a corner for the rest of the fight. When King Rastakhan reaches 60% health remaining, Bwonsomdi will pull half the raid (closest raid members to him) into the death realm. In the death realm you will always gain stacks of&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/king-rastakhan/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/website/AEPblackwater-1024x576.jpg" loading="lazy" class="post__author-thumb" alt="niseko"> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/" class="feed__author invert">niseko</a> <time datetime="2019-03-01T17:34" class="feed__date">March 1, 2019</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/conclave-of-the-chosen/" class="invert">Conclave of the Chosen</a></h2></header><div class="feed__image"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/conclave-of-the-chosen/"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/54/Conclave.jpg" srcset="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/54/responsive/Conclave-xs.jpg 300w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/54/responsive/Conclave-sm.jpg 480w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/54/responsive/Conclave-md.jpg 768w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/54/responsive/Conclave-lg.jpg 1024w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/54/responsive/Conclave-xl.jpg 1360w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/54/responsive/Conclave-2xl.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" loading="lazy" height="720" width="1280" alt=""></a></div><div class="wrapper"><p>Fight MechanicsConclave is this raid's council boss. You are first tasked with fighting both the Aspect of Pa'ku and Gonk. When one of them is defeated, the Aspect of Kimbul joins the encounter. When the second Aspect is killed, Akunda's Aspect joins the fight. When all four are defeated, the encounter is over. When any of the four Aspect dies, a Cry of the Fallen is triggered dealing large amounts of raid damage, as well as a Loa's Wrath which increases the damage of all remaining active Aspects by 15%. This means Kimbul and Akunda will both spawn with 15% increased damage since they enter the fight after another Aspect is slain. Throughout the encounter, multiple Loa show up in spirit form and perform some sort of attack. The Loa have the following abilities: The Aspects themselves have a few notable abilities. Gonk's Aspect casts Crawling Hex which will hex multiple raid members and if they are dispelled near other players will cause the other players to be hexed. Pa'ku's Aspect casts Gift of the Wind which causes all bosses and minions in the room to gain movement speed and haste. This needs to be purged or dispelled as quickly as possible. Kimbul's Aspect casts a frontal cleave that leaves a large bleed on anyone hit, prioritize healing these targets. Akunda's Aspect casts Mind Wipe which causes a 30 second lockout on all abilities and spells unless dispelled. This is a magic debuff meaning it can only be dispelled by healers or priests with mass dispel. Since this encounter has strictly windows of burst damage and Bwonsomdi's Curse soaks bounces of Chain Heal, it is recommended that you either take Wellspring. Using Wellspring will help cover the more consistent raid damage from Kimbul's Wrath.

If you are placed on the left hallway, you will have to deal with healing people who get Volatile Charge. If you are targeted with Volatile Charge, make sure it expires on you when you are at the side of the room, preferably where you entered rather than where you need to go. If you are on the right side, you will have to deal with Flames of Punishment. Stay behind the boss to avoid taking damage from Flames of Punishment. On either side, avoid being infront of the mini-boss when they cast Crush. Once a mini-boss has taken 10% of its health in damage, it will move to the next trapped room. The traps in the room follow this pattern: In the final room, the mini-bosses will pulse damage to raid members in the room with them, as well as their special abilities (Volatile Charge and Flames of Punishment) grow in size. As a Restoration Shaman you will be grabbing either the Amethyst or Sapphire gem. If you are grabbing Amethyst, you will want to heal everyone with Thief's Bane before it expires to prevent them from dying. Also when you reach phase 2 you will need to cover the entire raid with Shadow-Touched to prevent them from dying to Wail of Greed. On Mythic difficulty, DPS members will periodically be transferred between sides, 2 at a time. You don't have to worry about this as a healer. The other mythic change is the duration of Shadow-Touched and Tailwinds is much shorter on Mythic which means you'll need to reapply these buffs much more often. In Phase 2, you will actually be fighting Opulence.
