has. The only consistent raid damage is from the tank's Rising Flames stacks expire. Other than that, there are spikes of raidwide damage during each of the boss's special abilities. The first, Fire of the Mist causes three living bombs to spawn around the room shrouded in mist that explode every few seconds. You will likely want to use multiple raid cooldowns during this as your raid will be constantly moving from bomb to bomb with line of sight issues caused by the mist around each of the bombs. The second special ability is A Flash of Hostility which will spawn a maze made up of Ring of Peace. During this, there will be constant raid damage until the Barrier seperating the bosses from the raid is killed. You will want at least one healing cooldown while the raid is moving to the barrier. The final special ability is The Serpent and the Phoenix which the causes the bosses to turn into a dragon and a phoenix. There is constant AoE damage as long as the phoenix lives. Try to not step in Magma Traps as a shaman since we have no way to stop ourselves from dying to falling damage. Make sure you dispel Searing Embers before it expires as it will cause a large amount of raid damage. On mythic difficulty, when the monk boss casts Multi-Sided Strike, you will likely go up in the air and have to look at 5 monk spirits in the following order: Blue, Green, Red, Green, Blue. You could consider taking Ascendance over HT since this fight has no real sustained damage until the bosses reach 100 energy which is at the very end of the fight.

Depending on Faction you'll see different names for the same abilities and they'll be listed as Horde / Alliance. This is a fight filled with constant raidwide AoE damage while also having high tank damage. Every form of raidwide damage in this encounter is done in large chunks. The first of which is Grong's Ferocious Roar. Make sure you are standing near one other player when Grong casts Ferocious Roar to not get feared. In Mythic, the fear turns to a horrify which means Tremor Totem has no use. Next, after each Bestial Combo, Grong will cast Bestial Throw which deals raid damage that decreases with distance the throw is from the boss. If you are targeted by the throw, run away from your raid members so they don't get hit by the impact, but more importantly run away from Grong to reduce overall raid damage. Grong's final raid damage ability is Reverberating Slam which targets a melee and does damage in a large area around that melee player. More than likely, every melee player will be hit by this mechanic so they will need to be healed. After the slam, a Reverberating Echo will happen a few seconds later. Do not stand in the Reverberating Echo. Ranged players will be targeted by Megatomic Seeker Missles / Voodoo Blasts. Move quickly out of the fire on the ground caused by these mechanics. Lastly, when Grong reaches full energy or when triggered by using a Apetagonizer Core / Necrotic Core, he will cast Tantrum / Death Knell. For each 25 energy Grong has, he will deal a large amount of raid damage and leave a stack of Shattered / Death Touched. This causes your raid to always be taking a small amount of damage&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/grong/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/website/AEPblackwater-1024x576.jpg" loading="lazy" class="post__author-thumb" alt="niseko"> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/" class="feed__author invert">niseko</a> <time datetime="2019-03-01T17:30" class="feed__date">March 1, 2019</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/champion-of-the-light/" class="invert">Champion of the Light</a></h2></header><div class="feed__image"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/champion-of-the-light/"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/50/Champion.jpg" srcset="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/50/responsive/Champion-xs.jpg 300w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/50/responsive/Champion-sm.jpg 480w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/50/responsive/Champion-md.jpg 768w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/50/responsive/Champion-lg.jpg 1024w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/50/responsive/Champion-xl.jpg 1360w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/50/responsive/Champion-2xl.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" loading="lazy" height="720" width="1280" alt=""></a></div><div class="wrapper"><p>Fight MechanicsWhile Champion of the Light is the first encounter in Battle of Dazar'alor, there are a few key mechanics to look out for as a healer. There is raid wide damage every time the boss melees during Seal of Retribution. Use AoE healing spells frequently to combat this. Also the tank who is tanking the main boss will be taking increased damage over time from Sacred Blade, make sure to keep an eye on this tank as you are healing the raid. When Seal of Retribution ends and Seal of Reckoning begins the constant raid damage will cease. Any damage done to the boss from a target without Sacred Blade will cause the boss to gains stacks of Zealotry. When all the adds are defeated or when the boss reaches full energy, the boss will cast Judgement: Reckoning which you will want to use defensive cooldowns for. Lastly, the boss will periodically cast Wave of Light. Make sure to dispel anyone who is hit by the wave as it deals a large amount of damage over time. Once the boss hits 30% health, it will cast Avenging Wrath, increasing its damage by 30%. On mythic difficulty, the boss will also cast Prayer for the Fallen. During this cast any Disciple adds, and their ghosts will need to be interrupted, use Wind Shear to prevent them from healing the boss to full health. Also the Crusader adds will cast Divine Mallet which sends out a spiral of hammers in four directions that deal damage on contact with players. Due to the constant raid damage present during most off the encounter EWT and HT are recommended. You could drop CBT in favor of Downpour as they will perform similarly throughput wise, but CBT is one less global and slightly more efficient&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/champion-of-the-light/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/website/AEPblackwater-1024x576.jpg" loading="lazy" class="post__author-thumb" alt="niseko"> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/" class="feed__author invert">niseko</a> <time datetime="2018-12-11T01:35" class="feed__date">December 11, 2018</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/changes-in-81/" class="invert">Changes in 8.1</a></h2></header><div class="feed__image"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/changes-in-81/"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/49/D3HV3JXBITRA1543857950134.jpg" srcset="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/49/responsive/D3HV3JXBITRA1543857950134-xs.jpg 300w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/49/responsive/D3HV3JXBITRA1543857950134-sm.jpg 480w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/49/responsive/D3HV3JXBITRA1543857950134-md.jpg 768w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/49/responsive/D3HV3JXBITRA1543857950134-lg.jpg 1024w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/49/responsive/D3HV3JXBITRA1543857950134-xl.jpg 1360w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/49/responsive/D3HV3JXBITRA1543857950134-2xl.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" loading="lazy" height="675" width="1200" alt=""></a></div><div class="wrapper"><p>Spell and Talent ChangesIn patch 8.1, Tides of Vengeance, Chain Heal is being buffed by 33.3%. This change brings Chain Heal back into relevancy for raid healing for all talent builds. Along with this buff to Chain Heal, High Tide has received a rework. High Tide no longer adds an additional bounce to Chain Heal while also reducing bounce falloff. Instead, upon spending 40,000 mana, you will gain two charges of High Tide. These charges are consumed on your next two casts of Chain Heal increasing the healing of that Chain Heal by 20% and causing it to have no bounce falloff. This means all bounces of Chain Heal will heal for the same base amount and they are all buffed by 20%. In addition, Unleash Life is receiving changes as well. The upfront healing of Unleash Life is being increased by about 18%. To counterbalance this change, the increased healing on your next healing spell is being reduced from an increase of 45% to 35%. This change is pretty much overall neutral and makes sense when considering the potential of Unleash Life with the new High Tide. The increased upfront healing also means the opportunity cost of using Unleash Life is much lower since it heals for slightly less than a Healing Surge. Overall when you add the spellpower from Unleash Life with the spell it buffed, there is almost no change in the total spellpower (slightly favoring the 8.1 version) when used on Healing Wave, Healing Surge, and Riptide. Chain Heal gains more from the 8.1 changes due to the 33.3% buff which outweighs the difference in the Unleash Life change. The total effectiveness of UnL + CH in patch 8.1 yields a gain of around 20% spellpower when UnL is used on a CH in comparison to their 8.0&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/changes-in-81/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/website/AEPblackwater-1024x576.jpg" loading="lazy" class="post__author-thumb" alt="niseko"> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/" class="feed__author invert">niseko</a> <time datetime="2018-10-14T03:30" class="feed__date">October 14, 2018</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/restoration-shaman-spreadsheet/" class="invert">Restoration Shaman Spreadsheet</a></h2></header><div class="feed__image"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/restoration-shaman-spreadsheet/"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/48/sime-basioli-181541.jpg" srcset="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/48/responsive/sime-basioli-181541-xs.jpg 300w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/48/responsive/sime-basioli-181541-sm.jpg 480w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/48/responsive/sime-basioli-181541-md.jpg 768w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/48/responsive/sime-basioli-181541-lg.jpg 1024w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/48/responsive/sime-basioli-181541-xl.jpg 1360w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/48/responsive/sime-basioli-181541-2xl.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" loading="lazy" height="1080" width="1920" alt=""></a></div><div class="wrapper"><p>Ancestral Guidance The Restoration Shaman Spreadsheet Create a copy by clicking the link in the Info Box in the top right. Alternatively use this link. Your own copy of the Spreadsheet gives you access to a lot of different tools, with an estimation of stat weights based on logs – such as Azerite Gear Comparison, trinket estimations and weapon enchant information. All this is based on log information giving you stat weights, and some look at how much you use certain abilities (Overflowing Shores is directly linked to your Healing Rain casts). The data that's already in the spreadsheet is based off of logs of various mythic kills of the members of Ancestral Guidance, trying to get a healthy balance of different types of bosses and players. Inserting your own information will personalize this data to how you play. The Data that's most useful are progress kills as they usually involve you trying your best and not cheesing anything – using fights where you actually have something to heal is good as well, since having a lot of downtime can screw with the results.

If you are not familiar with this encounter, check out our heroic guide by clicking the button below. Heroic Guide The mythic version of G'huun introduces two new mechanics and has some changes to the mechanics of Power Matrix. The change to Power Matrix is quite involved. First, you are unable to use abilities while holding a Power Matrix. Second, once you pick up a Power Matrix, causes a Matrix Surge to chase after the holder of the Power Matrix which will kill anyone if they are hit by it. The third change is you need to dunk two Power Matrix's into the Reorigination Drive within 3 seconds of each other. This means as a raid you will need to dedicate multiple players to dunking both sides of Power Matrix's at the same time. The easiest way to go about this is to have a total of four warlocks use Demonic Gateways (2 on each side) to deliver the Power Matrix's to the Reorigination Drive as fast as possible without needing to clear the Amorphous Cysts that are on the upper level. There is one last change to orb running which involves the Amorphous Cysts new ability, Tendrils of Corruption. Tendrils of Corruption move between the Amorphous Cysts that root any player that touches them. If you move along the upper level with an emphasis on staying towards the arena, you should never be in the path of the Tendrils of Corruption. On the arena floor, you will notice a few changes, the first of which resembles the Infested mythic+ affix.

While above 50% health, it casts Void Echoes and Obliteration Blast in a cyclic pattern. Every successful cast of Void Echoes increases the damage of Void Echoes by 50% until Xalzaix is brought below 50% health which causes him to retreat back to Mythrax. In the intermission phases Mythrax retreats to his starting position rather than the center of the room. This is because Xalzaix flies to one of the other three corners. Mythrax then aims his Obliteration Beam at Xalzaix who redirects the beam to a random non-tank player. Bait this by stacking all your ranged players together and move between two points every time a beam is cast. Due to the spread nature of the fight, Wellspring has diminished effectiveness, so High Tide is the go to talent. For tier 90 talents, your only options are Flash Flood and CBT. If you take CBT, time it so you have no chance of healing Mythrax if you were to get mind controlled by an Oblivion Sphere with the explosion of CBT. The last option for talent swaps from this setup is Echo over ES. ES is strong on this fight due to generally needing one healer to be with the second tank away from the group during intermissions. Shamans are great at this job due to having Wind Shear and ES helps your lack of&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/mythrax-mythic/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/website/AEPblackwater-1024x576.jpg" loading="lazy" class="post__author-thumb" alt="niseko"> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/" class="feed__author invert">niseko</a> <time datetime="2018-10-05T18:05" class="feed__date">October 5, 2018</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/zul-mythic/" class="invert">Zul Mythic</a></h2></header><div class="feed__image"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/zul-mythic/"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/44/mzul.jpg" srcset="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/44/responsive/mzul-xs.jpg 300w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/44/responsive/mzul-sm.jpg 480w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/44/responsive/mzul-md.jpg 768w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/44/responsive/mzul-lg.jpg 1024w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/44/responsive/mzul-xl.jpg 1360w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/44/responsive/mzul-2xl.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" loading="lazy" height="720" width="1280" alt=""></a></div><div class="wrapper"><p>This guide will assume you are familiar with the Heroic version of the fight and expand on how the fight changes in Mythic difficulty. If you are not familiar with this encounter, check out our heroic guide by clicking the button below. Heroic Guide Like many other fights in Uldir, there are very few changes to Zul on mythic that impact healers. The only one that really matters is the Pool of Darkness applying stacks of Corrupted Blood. This means you will need to add a little more priority healing to people who are soaking Pool of Darkness. As a shaman you may need to purge Decaying Flesh off an add to force it onto another add to permanently kill an add. The jump order for Decaying Flesh is always Crawg to Bloodhexer to Crusher. The second phase of Zul is the only healing intensive phase so look to take the standard AoE healing talents. You could take NG over GS if you aren't having to move much in the last phase. Look for any traits that improve AoE healing. Overflowing Shores, Sprouting Spirits, and Swelling Stream are all excellent choices to fulfill the need of AoE healing. Ancestral Resonance has potential on this fight if someone else can use Bloodlust / Heroism on pull so you can get a large mastery buff in the final phase where healing actually matters. Ebb and Flow has potential since the entire raid is stacked in the final phase.Mythic Healing TipsDPS as much as possible in phase 1.Time Wellspring with Dark Revelations in phase 1.Keep Healing Rain down 100% in phase 2.Drop EWT as soon as you enter phase 2 and use it on cooldown.Don't worry too much about mana management since this fight is so short.</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/zul-mythic/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/website/AEPblackwater-1024x576.jpg" loading="lazy" class="post__author-thumb" alt="niseko"> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/" class="feed__author invert">niseko</a> <time datetime="2018-10-05T18:04" class="feed__date">October 5, 2018</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/vectis-mythic/" class="invert">Vectis Mythic</a></h2></header><div class="feed__image"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/vectis-mythic/"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/43/mvec.jpg" srcset="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/43/responsive/mvec-xs.jpg 300w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/43/responsive/mvec-sm.jpg 480w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/43/responsive/mvec-md.jpg 768w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/43/responsive/mvec-lg.jpg 1024w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/43/responsive/mvec-xl.jpg 1360w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/43/responsive/mvec-2xl.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" loading="lazy" height="720" width="1280" alt=""></a></div><div class="wrapper"><p>This guide will assume you are familiar with the Heroic version of the fight and expand on how the fight changes in Mythic difficulty. If you are not familiar with this encounter, check out our heroic guide by clicking the button below. Heroic Guide Vectis is largely unchanged in mythic when compared to heroic. The boss largely functions the exact same in terms of his cast sequencing as well as the overall flow of the fight. The mythic additions have to deal with Omega Vector and the stacks of Lingering Infection it leaves behind. Firstly, there are now four Omega Vectors on mythic for your raid to bounce around. It is easiest to deal with this by assigning five players to stack on a point for phase 1 for each Omega Vector (total of 4 stack points). Ideally you will want to have everyone keep their stacks of Lingering Infection low due to the new interaction Lingering Infection has with Contagion. When Vectis casts Contagion, any players with 6 or more stacks of LI will trigger Bursting Lesions. This causes the players afflicted to pulse moderate damage to any other players within 5 yards. If any players have 12 stacks of LI when Contagion is cast, an Engorged Parasite will spawn which casts Caustic Bile and Parasitic Discharge. If you somehow get to 25 or more stacks, and Contagion is cast, you will trigger Terminal Eruption which will instantly kill any players at 25 or more stacks and deal large raid wide damage to all other players. The only other change to this fight is the amount of healing needed to remove Immunosuppression which is increased substantially. The talent selection for Vectis is pretty straight forward in terms of you are looking to maximize stacked healing.

Instead, several mechanics have several additions as well as both the projections of Yogg-Saron and C'thun being active the entire fight. In addition, the last titan disc activates at 40% instead of 30%. The first change to Zek'voz's abilities is the addition of another Surging Darkness tick. The first safe spot of every Surging Darkness is the middle ring, which is then followed up by either inner or outer, then middle, then inner or outer again. In addition, when Zek'voz summons small adds, both Silithid Warriors and Nerubian Voidweavers spawn at the same time. The projections of Yogg-Saron and C'thun take turns between casting Roiling Deceit and Eye Beam. The first mechanic will always be Roiling Deceit, then Eye Beam. Depending on when you push into the sub 40% phase you can skip one of these mechanics and get back to back of the other mechanic. Upon pushing into the sub 40% phase, Silithid Warriors and Nerubian Voidweavers stop spawning, but the projections of Yogg-Saron and C'thun continue to cast Roiling Deceit and Eye Beam. Lastly, Eye Beam's cast time is reduced to 1.5 seconds. Always pre-spread for Eye Beam to avoid chaining hits. Standard raiding talents are suggested for Zek'voz. Graceful Spirit is great due to the amount of movement required on Surging Darkness casts. Wellspring, Downpour and EWT are all great for dealing with the consecutive bursts of damage on this fight. You can consider taking CBT if you feel that downpour isn't being&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/zekvoz-mythic/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><nav class="wrapper pagination desc"><div class="pagination__item"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/page/5/" class="readmore">Previous</a></div><div class="pagination__item"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/page/3/" class="readmore">Next </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></nav></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Footer Section</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
