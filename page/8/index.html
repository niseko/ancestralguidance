and at the time of posting this is generally approached in one of two ways. Guilds will ether 4 heal the boss, splitting the raid into three groups of 9/9/2 warlocks, or they will 5 heal, splitting the raid similarly, but not forcing the 2 warlocks requirement, as there will be an extra healer for the small group on the last robot. There are also generally 2 robot kill orders used, with the final robot kill order going Red-&gt;Red-&gt;Purple-&gt;Red or Red-&gt;Purple-&gt;Red-&gt;Red. Regardless of your guild’s strategy, your approach to the fight as a shaman should remain about the same. In Kin'garoth's primary active phase, there are only three major abilities that affect non-tanks (please don't stand on your tanks): For Legendaries any combination of Prydaz/Velens/Roots/Soul can be used on this encounter depending on your gear (likely the setup that gives you the best itemization will end up performing the best for you here). If all else is equal, Prydaz will help smooth incoming burst damage if you get targeted by Reverberating Strike at the same time a Diabolic Bomb is being popped. If you can consistently get good Chain Heal value, Soul drastically loses value. As I noted on the mechanics tab, try to adjust assignments during Apocalypse Protocol so your group has as many melee DPS as possible. The AoE damage during these phases get extremely high as the boss gains increased damage done during the encounter, and allowing your tier and Healing Rain to get maximum value make healing the phase significantly easier. Apocalypse Protocol phases are almost exactly 2 minutes apart, so if you are struggling with healing during these phases, note that you can simply avoid using AG and SWG during the first active phase and then proceed to save those CDs for every construction phase of&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/kingaroth-mythic/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/website/AEPblackwater-1024x576.jpg" loading="lazy" class="post__author-thumb" alt="niseko"> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/" class="feed__author invert">niseko</a> <time datetime="2017-12-23T12:10" class="feed__date">December 23, 2017</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/imonar-the-soulhunter-mythic/" class="invert">Imonar the Soulhunter Mythic</a></h2></header><div class="feed__image"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/imonar-the-soulhunter-mythic/"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/11/imonar.jpg" srcset="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/11/responsive/imonar-xs.jpg 300w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/11/responsive/imonar-sm.jpg 480w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/11/responsive/imonar-md.jpg 768w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/11/responsive/imonar-lg.jpg 1024w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/11/responsive/imonar-xl.jpg 1360w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/11/responsive/imonar-2xl.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" loading="lazy" height="720" width="1280" alt=""></a></div><div class="wrapper"><p>PRIMARY MECHANICSInstead of touching on the mechanics individually on this fight, I’ll overview how to approach the fight in a section by section overview. The most important aspect of this encounter is your approach to the obstacle course gauntlet of traps/bombs/mines. There are two different style gauntlets during the fight, the first is the path that involves Imonar dropping the green runes and green knockback mines - Pulse Grenades and Stasis Traps, and the second involving the red tripwires and red frag mines - Blastwire and Shrapnel Blast. These gauntlets alternate, and will happen roughly 1:30 apart for progressing guilds. The phases of the boss where you can actually hit Imonar are significantly easier in comparison, and generally involve dispelling sleep canister when there are no nearby players, and aiming the targeted lasers from the nearby ships away from the raid - Charged Blasts. For Legendaries Prydaz/Velens is usually the best combo for this one, unless you aren’t taking care of the burst healing at the start of transition 2/4. If that is the case Roots/Soul are also good options to consider if they improve your gear standing, but due to the nature of the fight Prydaz/Velens will usually give the most meaningful boost to performance. When approaching the start of transitions 2 and 4, make sure you begin placing your healing down at the edge of the bridge a few percent before the boss phases. As the first tripwires are being placed, you will want your CBT, HTT, and Healing Rain already placed, before popping SLT and AG/Asc/Velens. A Shaman can essentially solo carry that phase, relieving a lot of the burst healing stress from your other healers. When running through transitions 1 and 3, make sure you’re always aware of who has Empowered Pulse Grenade and where they are located behind the raid. If you’re not targeted, make sure when you get to the end of the bridge before them,&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/imonar-the-soulhunter-mythic/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/website/AEPblackwater-1024x576.jpg" loading="lazy" class="post__author-thumb" alt="niseko"> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/" class="feed__author invert">niseko</a> <time datetime="2017-12-23T12:06" class="feed__date">December 23, 2017</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/eonar-the-lifebinder-mythic/" class="invert">Eonar the Lifebinder Mythic</a></h2></header><div class="feed__image"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/eonar-the-lifebinder-mythic/"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/10/eonar.jpg" srcset="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/10/responsive/eonar-xs.jpg 300w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/10/responsive/eonar-sm.jpg 480w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/10/responsive/eonar-md.jpg 768w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/10/responsive/eonar-lg.jpg 1024w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/10/responsive/eonar-xl.jpg 1360w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/10/responsive/eonar-2xl.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" loading="lazy" height="720" width="1280" alt=""></a></div><div class="wrapper"><p>PRIMARY MECHANICSEonar just wants to be left alone, but all these rude guys just want to get up in her grill. It’s your job to slap them away. To be honest there are TONS of ways to do this boss, and 90% of the time you simply need to stick to your assigned group and traverse through the fight as mobs spawn around the zone. As a healer you will almost always be assigned to handling one of the Paraxis groups, and you will also likely pick up the yellow debuff. This debuff will cause damage to you for any movement you make, and stacks the more you move. Simply just try to remain stationary as much as possible to reduce the impact of this ability while you continue to handle your group assignments. To be honest you can take literally any talent setup and complete any assignment you are given within reason. Most of your selections should just be made based on that/where you are assigned and who you are with. I highly recommend Lightning Surge Totem on the small waves of adds. Roots/Prydaz/Velens/Soul are the good choices here, but to be honest if you’re standing in the places you’re supposed to be standing you can rock bracers/belt and still be falling asleep the whole fight. Really the only tips to give for this fight is that if you quickly tap your “W” key with the yellow debuff you can inch in a direction without stacking up your movement debuff. You also don’t stack up the debuff while flying in a straight line with your extra action button.</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/eonar-the-lifebinder-mythic/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/website/AEPblackwater-1024x576.jpg" loading="lazy" class="post__author-thumb" alt="niseko"> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/" class="feed__author invert">niseko</a> <time datetime="2017-12-22T16:48" class="feed__date">December 22, 2017</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/portal-keeper-hasabel-mythic/" class="invert">Portal Keeper Hasabel Mythic</a></h2></header><div class="feed__image"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/portal-keeper-hasabel-mythic/"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/9/DQOpqKSUMAECYcH.jpg" srcset="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/9/responsive/DQOpqKSUMAECYcH-xs.jpg 300w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/9/responsive/DQOpqKSUMAECYcH-sm.jpg 480w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/9/responsive/DQOpqKSUMAECYcH-md.jpg 768w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/9/responsive/DQOpqKSUMAECYcH-lg.jpg 1024w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/9/responsive/DQOpqKSUMAECYcH-xl.jpg 1360w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/9/responsive/DQOpqKSUMAECYcH-2xl.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" loading="lazy" height="720" width="1280" alt=""></a></div><div class="wrapper"><p>PRIMARY MECHANICSAs a shaman you can be assigned two different jobs on this boss, as you can both comfortably heal the downstairs platform as well as heal the upstairs groups. The downstairs healing job is extremely easy, and there are essentially no changes from heroic other than the difference in damage taken to the raid. I won’t touch too much on the downstairs healing job, as there is little to do other than drop CBT for every collapsing world (which once again happens to be on a 30-32 second cooldown). The only real note to healing downstairs is to make sure you utilize Lightning Surge Totem and Wind Shear as much as possible when your portal team is upstairs in order to minimize risk of wipes to the mismanagement of imps. Healing CDs should also be used while the portal team is upstairs, as you will be taking extra AoE damage downstairs while also being down a healer. If you are assigned to the portals as a shaman, congrats on being the mechanic bitch for the fight - on the plus side it probably means your raid leader doesn’t think you’re completely inept. For Legendaries while healing downstairs, any combination of Prydaz/Velens/Roots/Fire can be used on this encounter depending on your gear (likely the setup that gives you the best itemization will end up performing the best for you here). If you’re healing portals, Prydaz/Velens/Roots/Soul are all good choices, with soul pulling ahead in smaller portal groups, and falling behind in larger ones. The portals were detailed pretty heavily before, but overall this is yet another fight that CBT timing is an extremely important part of your play. Getting strong CBTs in conjunction with collapsing world will greatly help smooth out the damage curve of the encounter. I will also reiterate the importance of using Lightning Surge and Wind Shear throughout the fight, whether it involves kicking and&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/portal-keeper-hasabel-mythic/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/website/AEPblackwater-1024x576.jpg" loading="lazy" class="post__author-thumb" alt="niseko"> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/" class="feed__author invert">niseko</a> <time datetime="2017-12-22T16:23" class="feed__date">December 22, 2017</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/antoran-high-command-mythic/" class="invert">Antoran High Command Mythic</a></h2></header><div class="feed__image"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/antoran-high-command-mythic/"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/8/5629.jpg" srcset="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/8/responsive/5629-xs.jpg 300w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/8/responsive/5629-sm.jpg 480w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/8/responsive/5629-md.jpg 768w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/8/responsive/5629-lg.jpg 1024w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/8/responsive/5629-xl.jpg 1360w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/8/responsive/5629-2xl.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" loading="lazy" height="720" width="1280" alt=""></a></div><div class="wrapper"><p>PRIMARY MECHANICSAntoran High Command is a three boss encounter, however the fight does not change too much from boss to boss. There are essentially only four major abilities that affect the raid - three of which are active at a time. For ease I will be describing the boss simply by which boss is active in numbered order, eg. Boss 1/2/3. For Legendaries any combination of Prydaz/Velens/Roots can be used on this encounter depending on your gear (likely the setup that gives you the best itemization will end up performing the best for you here). There can be arguments made for Fire in the Deep if it works with your gear really well since the raid is stacked quite often. If your raid is constantly struggling to keep up the players targeted by Shock Grenade, Soul of the Farseer can be considered as well, but it is not ideal for this one overall. It is extremely important to time your CBT with the first Fusillade properly, as you will have VERY little leeway to adjust your drop timing if you drop it too late on the first one. Go out of your way to stare at that timer, and note that bigwigs has a timer that counts to the START of the Fusillade cast, that is then followed by another 10 second timer for the impact (as of the current build - always subject to change at a moment’s notice). Because of the sheer volume of damage during this fight it’s extremely important to coordinate healing CDs with your teammates to prevent overlapping and potential waste. If your raid is struggling to keep up with the AoE damage of the Entropic mines, try to get your inactive tank to pop extra mines as the Fusillade Shield goes up on the raid, to get the extra DR it provides.

I would recommend glancing over the dungeon journal for the details of the minor abilities. Below I will be touching on the combos/abilities that will likely cause issues for groups that are struggling with the boss. For Legendaries any combination of Prydaz/Velens/Roots/Soul can be used on this encounter depending on your gear (likely the setup that gives you the best itemization will end up performing the best for you here). If all else is equal, since the fight includes a lot of random snap damage, Prydaz is extremely valuable, and the choice between the others will most likely come down to personal preference. This fight is all about group coordination, and for much of the encounter it may feel like you are healing a 10 man raid (you will likely be in range of both groups quite often, but it may not always be the case). It’s very important to have CBT rolling into every 100 energy ability from either dog (matching color or not). This requires decent energy tracking of both dogs (yes you can get essentially all of them if you play on point) - I would recommend finding a good energy weakaura if you are concerned about the encounter. SLT should be saved for when you get Flametouched, as moving as a group for Siphon with SLT up essentially prevents any and all deaths during its duration, even with multiple mistakes.</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/felhounds-of-sargeras-mythic/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/website/AEPblackwater-1024x576.jpg" loading="lazy" class="post__author-thumb" alt="niseko"> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/" class="feed__author invert">niseko</a> <time datetime="2017-12-22T06:20" class="feed__date">December 22, 2017</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/garothi-worldbreaker-mythic/" class="invert">Garothi Worldbreaker Mythic</a></h2></header><div class="feed__image"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/garothi-worldbreaker-mythic/"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/6/1200px-Garothi_Worldbreaker.jpg" srcset="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/6/responsive/1200px-Garothi_Worldbreaker-xs.jpg 300w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/6/responsive/1200px-Garothi_Worldbreaker-sm.jpg 480w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/6/responsive/1200px-Garothi_Worldbreaker-md.jpg 768w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/6/responsive/1200px-Garothi_Worldbreaker-lg.jpg 1024w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/6/responsive/1200px-Garothi_Worldbreaker-xl.jpg 1360w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/6/responsive/1200px-Garothi_Worldbreaker-2xl.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" loading="lazy" height="675" width="1200" alt=""></a></div><div class="wrapper"><p>PRIMARY MECHANICSDecimation - This is the primary “AoE damage” ability of the encounter, and will be the ability that you will want to center your healing around. This ability targets six members of the raid and after a few seconds spawns a targeting circle under their feet. Moments later, a barrage of missiles will hit at the targeted location, dealing (likely lethal) damage to anyone standing inside, as well as unavoidable AoE damage to the raid.After destroying the Decimator during Apocalypse Drive, this ability will stun its 6 targets for a few seconds - preventing them from running out of the group with the targeting circles. Simply have the raid stack and move as a group for this after the empowerment.Annihilation - The soaking mechanic that we all grew to love (not so much) in ToS makes another debut here. The boss will simply shoot missiles into the air that create green circles on the ground when they land.After destroying the Annihilator during Apocalypse Drive, this ability will knock back anyone who soaks the missiles on the ground. After the initial soak, a fel crater will form, which will ALSO need to be soaked by either the same player (using a displacement or immunity) or another nearby player. The best way to handle this is to have your members pair off on the fly, or to simply have players that soak attempt to get knocked towards a crater after the initial hit.Apocalypse Drive - This is the intermission phase of the fight, and it simply requires you to dodge the green blasts on the ground until either the Decimator or Annihilator is destroyed (The easiest tactic is generally to kill the Decimator on the first Apocalypse Drive, and the Annihilator on the second). Once a weapon is destroyed, its respective ability will become&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/garothi-worldbreaker-mythic/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/website/AEPblackwater-1024x576.jpg" loading="lazy" class="post__author-thumb" alt="niseko"> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/" class="feed__author invert">niseko</a> <time datetime="2017-12-22T01:50" class="feed__date">December 22, 2017</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/playstyle-changes-for-antorus/" class="invert">Playstyle Changes for Antorus</a></h2></header><div class="feed__image"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/playstyle-changes-for-antorus/"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/5/647663.jpg" srcset="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/5/responsive/647663-xs.jpg 300w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/5/responsive/647663-sm.jpg 480w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/5/responsive/647663-md.jpg 768w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/5/responsive/647663-lg.jpg 1024w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/5/responsive/647663-xl.jpg 1360w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/5/responsive/647663-2xl.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" loading="lazy" height="1024" width="2048" alt=""></a></div><div class="wrapper"><p>Now that Antorus, the Burning Throne has been released, it’s important to talk about the state of restoration shaman as well as any changes to our playstyle. While there has been no changes to the base toolkit of restoration shamans going into Antorus, our new set bonuses impact our play drastically and present an extra skill cap to achieve in order to master your restoration shaman. Before we jump into details about the shift to our play style, let’s first cover what exactly our set bonuses do. The Tier 21 set, the Garb of Venerated Spirits, has a heavy influence on Healing Rain placement and timings.The 2 piece bonus provides an initial heal on up to 6 allies within the Healing Rain reticle when a cast is completed. This heals for 225% of spell power and scales off versatility and can critically strike. The healing produced by this bonus is called Rainfall. It is important to note that mastery does NOT have any effect on Rainfall. You can think of this bonus as whenever you cast Healing Rain, a Chain Heal’s worth of healing is divided amongst 6 targets in the area. The 4 piece bonus provides an alternative method of doing spot healing to multiple targets at the same time while being mana efficient. Everytime you cast Healing Wave or Healing Surge, an ally in your Healing Rain will be healed for 40% of the healing done by the Healing Wave or Healing Surge. The healing produced by this bonus is called Downpour. This bonus, like the 2 piece, does NOT scale with mastery on its own. Since the Healing Wave or Healing Surge does scale with mastery, the Downpour healing is calculated off the amount done therefore already has mastery scaling built in. Now this is where things get awkward.

Crit currently performs slightly ahead of the pack, while Mastery lags slightly behind. You should gem and enchant Crit, enchant Mark of the Ancient Priestess, and use the highest item level when gearing your character, adjusting with jewelry. The best way to begin is by reminding everyone, as mentioned before, that ALL OF OUR STATS ARE GOOD. In fact, having more of all of the stats makes them scale better yet. This is why, in Discord, you see the Ancestors, Ascendants and other regular users recommend a balance of secondary stats. If our stats are spread better, we are granted access to larger multipliers, and thus higher potential HPS numbers. Stats scale multiplicatively with each other following this formula: Direct Heals: Intellect * Artifact Weapon Multipliers * Spell coefficient * Effective-Mastery% * Crit% * Versatility% Healing over Time: Intellect * Artifact Weapon Multipliers * Spell coefficient * Effective-Mastery% * Crit% * Versatility% * Haste% The biggest thing to note is that it is likely that you will never possess absolute equality regarding stats. Titan-forging and item level increases play a strong role in stat distribution. With item level increases being so strong for us, you are going to use the upgrade regardless of it messing up your beautiful secondary distribution that you worked so hard for. Another consideration is how stat weights may vary by encounter and by spell selection. Stat balance is important, but if you are truly wanting to get the most out of your stats, adjustments should be made based on what you’re seeing and what you need. So you understand the concept, I will use Mythic Maiden of Vigilance as an example.

When setting these cooldowns up, it is important to look at what healers you are bringing to an encounter as well as whether the fight has lots of burst damage or sustained damage. To start, let’s go over all the healing cooldowns in the game class by class and where these abilities excel. Restoration Shaman Mistweaver Monk Holy Paladin Discipline Priest Holy Priest Restoration Druid Restoration Shaman Mistweaver Monk Holy Paladin Discipline Priest Holy Priest Restoration Druid As you can see, every class has their own large healing cooldown that is typically on a longer cooldown but has a large impact on overall raid healing. Most of these large healing cooldowns also heal over time or have longer duration windows in which the healing is spread over. These abilities are the ones that you will want to sync up with large pulses of raid damage or ticking damage. Most classes also have shorter cooldowns that are quite effective at taking care of small chip damage that happens throughout an encounter. Most of these small cooldowns synergize extremely well with Velen’s Future Sight since the cooldowns mostly line up with the trinket’s cooldown and increase the effectiveness of these small cooldowns into something significant. Shaman cooldowns are by far the most versatile since they all scale off our mastery which increases their throughput massively during critical periods of damage. The most flexible of our cooldowns is easily Ancestral Guidance (AG). On a two minute cooldown, it essentially replicates 60% of the healing you do and spreads it evenly across three targets. This healing feeds into cloudburst totem and ancestral guidance will then replicate the&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assigning-healing-cooldowns/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><nav class="wrapper pagination desc"><div class="pagination__item"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/page/9/" class="readmore">Previous</a></div><div class="pagination__item"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/page/7/" class="readmore">Next </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></nav></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Footer Section</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
