80%, 60%, 40%, and 20%. The only major change on Mythic is the fact that Clouded Mind now always affects players, which means that the Shred Psyche add in phase 1 will only be visible by half the raid at a time. This also makes the Images of Absolution harder to deal with because only half of the raid can see the adds. To deal with this, each tank should have a marker on their head, and whichever one can see the Images of Absolution should become the 'safe area' for the raid to follow. Following that tank should prevent you from running into the adds if they aren't visible to you. Dealing with the Images of Absolution and dragging the Shred Psyche add away from the group is all that really occurs in phase 1, so you should try to save healing CD's if you can for phase 2. In Phase 2 Skitra will cast Illusionary Projection, spawning identical copies of the boss spread randomly around the edges of the room. Tanks should coordinate with one another using world markers to find the correct add to kill. Your group should be careful during this phase as it may require lots of movement and the Images of Absolution may still be present, so you need to make sure you're travelling as a group. If you have to travel a far distance Wind Rush Totem may be valuable. While the Illusionary Projections are alive, the raid will take increasing ticking damage because of Dark Ritual. This means that eventually the damage will become too much to heal through, so there is a time limit to getting out of this phase quickly.

Occasionally Maut will cast Devour Magic which will drop a silencing pool on the ground whenever the debuff falls off the player. These will be important later on when the boss casts Stygian Annihilation as it prevents the damage from the ability. On Mythic, the Devour Magic pools serve an additional purpose, as they can dispel the Ancient Curse that happens twice in each Phase 1. Periodically, Maut will also cast Black Wings which will knock back any player within 40 yards of the cone. Ranged can dodge this ability completely if they stand away from the boss opposite of the melee group, as the boss will always target the melee with it. After the 2nd Ancient Curse or about the time the boss casts the 3rd Black Wings, the add tank should drag a few of the adds into the boss to transition the boss into Phase 2. When Phase 2 begins, Maut will run to the center of the platform and cast Obsidian Skin, along with a long channeled ability called Obsidian Shatter. Obsidian Skin will reflect 100% of the damage you deal back into you, which can be very deadly for some classes. Your raid also needs to do enough damage to drain Maut's mana such that he has 0 mana left before the Obsidian Shatter cast finishes, thus it's a balancing act of dealing enough damage to beat the Obsidian Shatter cast, but not enough to outright kill yourself with Obsidian Skin. Additionally, Maut will occasionally put Drain Essence on 2 friendlies, who will need dispelled as soon as possible. While this phase does require an immense amount of healing, tanks will be soaking Forbidden Mana orbs periodically, allowing healers to gain&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/maut/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/website/AEPblackwater-1024x576.jpg" loading="lazy" class="post__author-thumb" alt="niseko"> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/" class="feed__author invert">niseko</a> <time datetime="2020-04-12T00:40" class="feed__date">April 12, 2020</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/wrathion/" class="invert">Wrathion</a></h2></header><div class="feed__image"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/wrathion/"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/69/wrathion.jpg" srcset="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/69/responsive/wrathion-xs.jpg 300w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/69/responsive/wrathion-sm.jpg 480w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/69/responsive/wrathion-md.jpg 768w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/69/responsive/wrathion-lg.jpg 1024w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/69/responsive/wrathion-xl.jpg 1360w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/69/responsive/wrathion-2xl.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" loading="lazy" height="720" width="1280" alt=""></a></div><div class="wrapper"><p>Fight MechanicsWrathion is a 2 phase encounter that transitions between phase 1 and phase 2, separated by intermissions. On Mythic, players immediately start with Creeping Madness which will hinder the ability to move throughout the fight. You can safely stand still for most of Wrathion's abilities as a ranged, and even be far enough away so that Gale Blast will not affect you like it does the melee. Every so often he will cast Incineration on 3 random allies who need to run a bit away from the group to reduce the amount of damage you take. There are 2 Incineration casts per phase, and each phase is separated by about 3 minutes, so you can safely use raid-wide damage reductions like Spirit Link Totem on these abilities if you want. Occasionally the boss will cast Burning Cataclysm and you will need to move to the opposite side of the platform as his 'smoke cloud'. This is a great time to use Wind Rush Totem to allow the slower players to be able to reach the safe area in time. You will repeat these steps again before the boss transitions into his next phase. In Phase 2, three players will need to grab the Scales of Wrathion from under the boss and run through as many Crackling Shards as they can so the group can kill off as many as possible. Help kill some of the Crackling Shards that are far away from the boss so that the melee don't accidentally gain stacks from running back to Wrathion if he transitions back into Phase 1. A pretty standard talent setup is great for Wrathion, with the addition of Wind Rush Totem to help move your group during the intermissions.

This article will be updated as Alpha and Beta progresses with the relevant information. None Learn about what Covenants are over on Wowhead: https://www.wowhead.com/guides/shadowlands-covenant-overview-abilities-rewards The gist of it is that this is the new system for Shadowlands, replacing stuff like Essences. You have to pick 1 of the covenants and are stuck with that choice from what we know at this time, meaning you can only use 1 of the ability sets listed below. Each Covenant gives you 1 signature and 1 class specific ability and Soulbinds, which is another Artifact / Azerite like system. As there isn't enough information about Soulbinds yet, they're omitted for now. All of the shaman abilities are hybrid, meaning you can use them to either deal damage, or to heal. Just a few examples of the 6 first known transmog sets in Shadowlands. Some of them are still missing either animations or pieces of armor, and there's different color variations.

In the first phase you are tasked with fighting Cyranus and Aethanel. These two mini bosses have mostly negligible mechanics from a healer perspective except for Cyranus's Charged Spear. During this phase you will also be tasked with killing Overzealous Hulks before they are able to drain the power of the Wards of Power. Azshara will also occasionally drain a Ward of Power at random around the room. To recharge these wards you can stand in them but you will gain a stack of Drained Soul. Avoid getting more than 5 or 6 stacks of Drained Soul if possible. Azshara will also occasionally cast Beckon which will always target 1 healer and 1 ranged damage dealer. In this phase, the beckon spawn point will always be near the middle of the room. Avoid being mind controlled by walking as far from the image of Azshara as possible (outside edge of the room) Azshara will also occasionally spawn Arcane Orb around the room that must be soaked fully or else they will deal heavy raid damage. Only one person needs to soak each orb. Lastly, Azshara will cast Divide and Conquer which will split the room in half on one of the two diagonals (front left to back right or front right to back left from the perspective of when you first zone in to the room). Once Cyranus and Aethanel are deafted, Queen Azshara will move into her first intermission.

Za'qul starts out only having a few abilities. Za'qul occasionally casts Tentacles which spawns a tentacle somewhere on the outside of the room then spawns 2 more (counter clockwise to the first spawn). These tentacles shoot out in a straight line across the circle from their spawn point and will knockback any players in the line as well as do heavy damage (generally lethal). Za'qul will also spawn 3 Horrific Summoners as long as at least 1 player is in the normal realm. The last ability Za'qul has is Dread. Dread causes 4 raid members to run in fear and deals heavy raid wide damage when dispelled. Upon reaching 85% health, Za'qul opens the Fear Realm and drags the entire raid into the Fear Realm. While in the Fear Realm, all players inside gain a stack of Hysteria every 15 seconds. Za'qul also will mark two raid members with Manifest Nightmares which deals heavy periodic damage over a few seconds and leaves a Nightmare Pool near the afflicted player's feet every tick. Upon expiration a Horrific Vision will spawn from each player. The last mechanic, Maddening Eruption will kill you if you are stood in it when it goes off. For 20 seconds after the Maddening Eruption goes off, Za'qul takes 30% more damage. When Za'qul reaches 70% health, he will open the Delirium Realm. This realm is mostly for DPS players as any player who enters the Delirium Realm will be hostile to all other players within the realm.

It is similar to Heroic with the added mechanic of Sphere of Influence on Mythic difficulty, causing you to kite both bosses around the room in a clockwise motion. Like heroic, the majority of the damage comes from Form Ranks and Potent Spark, making those overlaps very difficult to deal with. Tanks should always keep the bosses at least 21 yards apart due to Separation of Power, as any time they are too close will result in a huge damage loss, making the already tight enrage even harder. The raid will have to deal with several Decrees throughout the fight; it's important you know which decree is active so you can deal with each of them effectively. Silivaz will occasionally use Frenetic Charge at a player, which will deal heavy split damage, so the raid should help the player soak the damage unless Stand Alone is currently active. During the Frenetic Charge and Stand Alone overlap, you can use external damage reductions, immunities, or simply opt to sacrifice the player with Frenetic Charge to avoid a large amount of damage caused by Stand Alone. Silivaz will also cast Zealous Eruption, and you must make sure to be inside of the bubble as it does an incredible amount of damage and will almost certainly kill you. Again, this is dangerous while Stand Alone is active, so be weary of people around you. Pashmar occasionally targets players with Fanatical Verdict, which will deal a large amount of damage, so players should try to avoid soaking other forms of damage if possible. Make sure you aren't inside Violent Outburst when it is finished casting. Lastly Pashmar will summon Potent Sparks, which will slowly die on their own, and when killed will&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/queens-court/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/website/AEPblackwater-1024x576.jpg" loading="lazy" class="post__author-thumb" alt="niseko"> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/" class="feed__author invert">niseko</a> <time datetime="2019-09-16T20:04" class="feed__date">September 16, 2019</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/orgozoa/" class="invert">Orgozoa</a></h2></header><div class="feed__image"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/orgozoa/"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/65/AEPorgo.jpg" srcset="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/65/responsive/AEPorgo-xs.jpg 300w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/65/responsive/AEPorgo-sm.jpg 480w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/65/responsive/AEPorgo-md.jpg 768w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/65/responsive/AEPorgo-lg.jpg 1024w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/65/responsive/AEPorgo-xl.jpg 1360w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/65/responsive/AEPorgo-2xl.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" loading="lazy" height="720" width="1280" alt=""></a></div><div class="wrapper"><p>Fight MechanicsOrgozoa is the fifth boss in The Eternal Palace, and is another 2 phase encounter. This fight is also similar to heroic, the major change is Arcing Current, which causes players with Incubation Fluid to spread it to other nearby players, so they will need to get away from the group. The first minute of this fight has almost no damage, so healers should be adding in as much damage as possible during this time. Tanks will still take a very large amount of damage if they do not have any Desensitizing Sting stacks, so if they are about to swap they need to have some sort of active mitigation. This is another fight where 3 tanking can make the fight easier, as one tank solely focuses on grabbing the adds and stacking them together while the other two tanks focus on the boss. Players should find safe areas to stand during Dribbling Ichor to avoid taking a large amount of damage. There are times when Amniotic Splatter soaks overlap with Dribbling Ichor, so it may be smart to use an immunity of some sort to soak the Amniotic Splatter. Players with Incubation Fluid will need to spread out on every Arcing Current cast to avoid chaining Incubation Fluid to the entire raid. While the Zoatroids are alive, they will cast Pervasive Shock, inflicting a good amount of AoE damage to the raid; this on top of the Incubation Fluid DoT will force healers to chain healing CD’s during the later parts of each phase. Once the boss phases at 40% all players lose their Incubation Fluid debuffs and the intermission begins; you have enough time to use no movement speed increases and walk down the ramp before the cast needs to be kicked, so you should play it safe and avoid getting&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/orgozoa/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/website/AEPblackwater-1024x576.jpg" loading="lazy" class="post__author-thumb" alt="niseko"> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/" class="feed__author invert">niseko</a> <time datetime="2019-09-16T20:03" class="feed__date">September 16, 2019</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/lady-ashvane/" class="invert">Lady Ashvane</a></h2></header><div class="feed__image"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/lady-ashvane/"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/64/AEPashvane.jpg" srcset="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/64/responsive/AEPashvane-xs.jpg 300w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/64/responsive/AEPashvane-sm.jpg 480w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/64/responsive/AEPashvane-md.jpg 768w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/64/responsive/AEPashvane-lg.jpg 1024w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/64/responsive/AEPashvane-xl.jpg 1360w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/64/responsive/AEPashvane-2xl.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" loading="lazy" height="720" width="1280" alt=""></a></div><div class="wrapper"><p>Fight MechanicsLady Ashvane is the fourth boss in The Eternal Palace, and is the first real “wall” of the instance. It is a 2 phase encounter that rotates between the phases (1-2-1-2, etc). There is a tight dps check on this fight so most guilds opt to use only 3 healers to ensure they will have enough damage to kill the boss before the boss casts his third Hardened Carapace. This boss will require excellent CD timings for both healers and DPS, as you want to maximize the amount of damage you’re dealing during the burn phases. The most common strategy for this encounter is to use a third tank as a ‘sacrificial lamb’ to soak a large majority of the Rippling Wave bubbles. Doing this will lower the raid damage taken by a very large amount, making it much easier to 3 heal. Throughout the fight 3 players will get affected by Briny Bubble, and should stack on top of each other outside of the group so they can get cleaved down quickly; these players will require extra healing while they’re inside the bubble (it is worth noting you are able to immune the bubbles to dodge the mechanic). These sometimes overlap with Upsurge, which can very easily kill players who have taken other sources of damage. Coral Growths will also spawn throughout the encounter, and tanks should try to position the boss in such a way that it won’t be right on top of the Coral Growths, otherwise it will be very hard to soak the Rippling Waves that spawn from it. The third tank should aim to soak every Rippling Wave possible while the boss has an active Hardened Carapace, otherwise it will replenish the Hardened Carapace, probably resulting in a wipe.

This fight is arguably the easiest of the first 3 bosses as it is very similar to heroic and the only added mechanic is very easy to deal with. Every ~18 seconds the raid will take a heavy burst of damage from Unshackled Power, which is the primary form of damage in this fight. On Mythic, one additional add is spawned during the intermissions, so you will need to split your raid in half once it is time for the Intermission. Similar to Heroic, healers will need to dispel players with Arcane Bomb once the player is in a safe location. Everyone should aim to dodge the tornadoes spawned by Arcanado Burst as it is completely avoidable damage. During the Intermissions the tank can pull the Stormwraith towards the edge of the Ancient Tempest so Gale Buffet wont knock you out of the circle. Alternatively, you can have your back up against the entrance stairs so you are instead knocked into them and avoid being displaced by the knockback. DPS and tanks should rotate kicks on the Stormling’s Chain Lightnings to avoid extra damage. This fairly ‘standard’ talent setup is great for this boss, especially because you’ll be splitting your raid in half, meaning you would be unable to make great use of Wellspring and Ascendance throughout the entire encounter. Wind Rush Totem can be used at the start of intermission to help your group move through the Squall Traps a bit easier. Spouting Spirits and Overflowing Shores will provide a large amount of healing, especially if you can get the majority of the raid to stack up when you use your Spirit Link. Due to the heavy raid healing every ~18 seconds and being separated from your entire raid group for prolonged&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/radiance-of-azshara/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><nav class="wrapper pagination desc"><div class="pagination__item"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/page/3/" class="readmore">Previous</a></div><div class="pagination__item"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/" class="readmore">Next </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></nav></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Footer Section</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
