For the the changes in Mythic difficulty, check out our Mythic guide by clicking the button below. Mythic Guide Taloc is a three phase encounter with phase three largely resembling phase one in terms of mechanics. In phases 1 and 3, the main source of raid damage is Cudgel of Gore. Taloc charges the active tank, and smashes his cudgel into the ground. This deals large raid damage that falls off the further you are from the smash. This is where you are going to want to use healing cooldowns. There are two other mechanics that we need to be concerned with as healers. The first of which is called Plasma Discharge. Taloc picks a few raid members and gives them a debuff that causes them to drop pools of Blood Storm - This debuff also does a moderate amount of damage over time. Standing in Blood Storm deals large amounts of damage as well. Be sure to single target heal people with Plasma Discharge as they will likely be running near each other and might get hit by Blood Storm pools. The last mechanic is Sanguine Static. Taloc will pick a random raid member and shoot a few projectiles along the floor in a cone like trajectory. The middle one will always be targeted at the selected raid member, with multiple side projectiles that deal damage on impact with players and cause a knockback. This is easily dodged and should be, but due to how small the room is in phase 1, expect to have to heal people getting hit by this. When phase 2 begins, Taloc will power down taking reduced damage while the elevator falls into a larger room.

These Lesser Chain Heals work exactly as the spell Chain Heal with a 30% reduction on bounces, but are not augmented by High Tide. The frequency of the totem casting Lesser Chain Heal does not scale with Haste. These Lesser Chain Heals do not feed Cloudburst Totem. By stacking multiples of this trait, only the healing of the Lesser Chain Heals is improved. Overflowing Shores &#8211; Improves the radius of Healing Rain by 10% as well as causes an initial burst of healing on up to 6 allies inside Healing Rain upon cast completion. Only the healing scales with multiple traits. Spouting Spirits &#8211; Provides healing 1 second after Spirit Link Totem is dropped as well as a 15% size increase to the totem&#8217;s effect. Stacking multiples of this trait improves the amount healed. Soothing Waters &#8211; Increases the healing of the initial heal of Chain Heal. This does not effect the bounces of Chain Heal at all. Stacking multiple traits adds more healing. Surging Tides &#8211; Adds an absorb shield when casting Riptide on targets below 50% health. This trait only applies to the initial heal of Riptide. Stacking multiples of this trait increases the size of the absorb shield. Turn of the Tide &#8211; Provides a 5% bonus to TW. Also increases healing on HW and HS when a charge of TW is consumed. Stacking multiple traits increases the healing provided when a TW charge is consumed. Ancestral Resonance &#8211; Provides a 10 second duration increase to your Bloodlust/Heroism.

The amount of mana it returns is minor and it also heals people in a chain heal like fashion. One of the best trinkets in the game for Restoration Shamans due to its high intellect proc, flat versatility and 40% extra mana from mana potions. This trinket has a limited potential though since it can only be crafted as high as 415 ilvl. This trinket amazing for early progression, since it is BoE and more than likely someone on your server will have this for sale.

In this article I'm going to explain these mechanics as best as possible. The three spells highlighted are Chain Heal, Wellspring, and Earth Shield. Some of these mechanics are very straight forward while others may still be confusing, such as in the case of Wellspring. When you cast a Chain Heal, the healing of each bounce is calculated in a specific way. First the base spell power coefficient calculates the initial healing of the Chain Heal. From here any modifiers that increase the healing of the entire Chain Heal are multiplied such as versatility and Unleash Life. Next, the bounce heals are calculated. To do so, the initial heal is multiplied by 0.7^x where x is the bounce count (no falloff if High Tide is talented and the buff is present). From here, mastery and critical strikes are applied to the initial heal and all bounces individually. Any other modifiers such as Earth Shield or Deluge are then applied to each individual bounce. This means that even if you have Earth Shield or Deluge talented it is always best to cast Chain Heal on the most injured target since the initial heal of Chain Heal is the strongest in the chain. Since you can only control the initial cast of Chain Heal it is important to understand how properly target select who to Chain Heal to best manipulate the jumps of Chain Heal. Chain Heal is a “super smart” heal meaning it will always prioritize healing the most injured target within bounce range. When calculating the "best route" to heal, Chain Heal heals targets that are missing the most health numerically rather than targets with the lowest percent health. An example of this is if a target is&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/hidden-spell-mechanics/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/website/AEPblackwater-1024x576.jpg" loading="lazy" class="post__author-thumb" alt="niseko"> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/" class="feed__author invert">niseko</a> <time datetime="2018-07-14T20:30" class="feed__date">July 14, 2018</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/changes-from-legion-to-bfa/" class="invert">Changes from Legion to BFA</a></h2></header><div class="feed__image"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/changes-from-legion-to-bfa/"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/26/World_of_Warcraft_Battle_for_Azeroth_Key_Art_2_Orc_v_Human.jpg" srcset="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/26/responsive/World_of_Warcraft_Battle_for_Azeroth_Key_Art_2_Orc_v_Human-xs.jpg 300w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/26/responsive/World_of_Warcraft_Battle_for_Azeroth_Key_Art_2_Orc_v_Human-sm.jpg 480w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/26/responsive/World_of_Warcraft_Battle_for_Azeroth_Key_Art_2_Orc_v_Human-md.jpg 768w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/26/responsive/World_of_Warcraft_Battle_for_Azeroth_Key_Art_2_Orc_v_Human-lg.jpg 1024w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/26/responsive/World_of_Warcraft_Battle_for_Azeroth_Key_Art_2_Orc_v_Human-xl.jpg 1360w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/26/responsive/World_of_Warcraft_Battle_for_Azeroth_Key_Art_2_Orc_v_Human-2xl.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" loading="lazy" height="1440" width="2560" alt=""></a></div><div class="wrapper"><p>With Battle for Azeroth coming out and Legion behind us I want to talk about the changes to spells as well as the specialization in general as well as what Azerite traits to look out for going into Uldir. Secondary stats retain a similar balance between each other in BFA as they did in Legion. Tertiary stats such as Leech and Avoidance received relative nerfs. This means you won’t be seeing upwards of 13% leech from only wearing 2-3 pieces of leech gear. This makes tertiary stats much weaker and avoidance cap will be much harder to obtain. In BFA our talents have been changed significantly with only tiers 15, 60, and 100 remaining unchanged. For more details about talents in Battle for Azeroth check out our talents guide here. Talents Guide The Heart of Azeroth is a new artifact necklace that we will be collecting Azerite Power to gain an empowered artifact. This necklace scales in item level in proportion to the number of levels you have unlocked. These levels also unlock Azerite Traits on Azerite Gear. Azerite Gear is limited to Helms, Shoulders, and Chest pieces. Each piece for a particular slot will always have the same traits. That means every shaman who obtains Mail of the Champion will have the same traits to choose from. As the item level of Azerite pieces increases, new rows of traits unlock (up to four currently). The outer ring of traits contains one option for each of the specializations of a class as well as one general purpose trait. Some traits can have some overlap that may work in other specializations, although currently most choices are between the relevant specialization of your choice and the general purpose trait.

Crit currently performs slightly ahead of the pack, while Mastery lags slightly behind. You should gem and enchant Crit, and use the highest item level when gearing your character, adjusting with jewelry. The best way to begin is by reminding everyone, as mentioned before, that ALL OF OUR STATS ARE GOOD. In fact, having more of all of the stats makes them scale better yet. This is why, in Discord, you see the Ancestors, Ascendants and other regular users recommend a balance of secondary stats. If our stats are spread better, we are granted access to larger multipliers, and thus higher potential HPS numbers. Stats scale multiplicatively with each other following this formula (calculating averages for crit): Direct Heals: Intellect * Spell coefficient * (1+Effective-Mastery%) * (1+Crit%) * (1+Versatility%) Healing over Time: Intellect * Spell coefficient * (1+Effective-Mastery%) * (1+Crit%) * (1+Versatility%) * (1+Haste%) The biggest thing to note is that it is likely that you will never possess absolute equality regarding stats. Titan-forging and item level increases play a strong role in stat distribution. With item level increases being so strong for us, you are going to use the upgrade regardless of it messing up your beautiful secondary distribution that you worked so hard for. Another consideration is how stat weights may vary by encounter and by spell selection. Stat balance is important, but if you are truly wanting to get the most out of your stats, adjustments should be made based on what you’re seeing and what you need. So you understand the concept, I will use Mythic Maiden of Vigilance as an example.

Very powerful for low to moderate spot healing, and has the additional boon of being a passive and requiring no micro managing. Healing Wave and Healing Surge are our staple single target healing spells. This talent requires a bit of skill to learn how to effectively use the 50% healing increase properly. If you don’t track which cast you are on out of the three you can easily waste this buff. In most scenarios maximizing this has little gain but can be a life saver. You almost always want to use this spell in conjunction with a Chain Heal as it buffs all the bounces as well as the initial hit. While competitive with both other options, it requires the most management in the tier and needs to be used effectively and constantly to maintain its edge. It is useful for constant raid damage as well as short interval burst damage. It is important to note that Unleash Life can be used while in Ghost Wolf. Echo of the Elements provides many players with a nice quality of life buff, as having additional charges of abilities makes it less important to watch cooldowns like a hawk. Echo of the Elements allows you to effectively use your Riptides as well as Healing Stream Totems. This talent gains considerable power when combined with Cloudburst Totem. This talent has low impact on most encounters. Deluge assists with heavy stacked fights where a majority of your raid is in Healing Rain and you need to be consistently casting Chain Heals to keep up with the damage.

In Legion the talent saw great effectiveness in raiding and mythic+. In Battle for Azeroth the power of CBT has been lowered significantly due to the loss of AG as well as CBT replacing HST. Cloudburst Totem is now a good option for conserving mana when compared to other talents in tier 90. It also gained some flexibility due to Echo of the Elements being moved to tier 30 talents which enables us to have 2 charges of CBT. The totem absorbs 25% of the healing YOU do during its 15 seconds window and distributes it equally to all injured players on a 40 yard range of your character and not the totem. This is a question I see very often on our discord and decided to use this space to clear some things out. Your totems, such as Healing Tide Totem, will not feed into Cloudburst. This also means the Azerite traits like Swelling Streams, Ebb and Flow, and Sprouting Spirits will not feed Cloudburst. Currently Overflowing Shores also does not provide any feeding. Only healing done by restoration shaman abiltites will feed into Cloudburst including talents. It’s also important to note that overhealing feeds Cloudburst as well. You want to be using Cloudburst Totem on cooldown or close to it in order to get maximum usage out of it. Taking Echo of the Elements helps in not wasting casts of CBT during low damage portions of an encounter. Having high casts of Cloudburst will ensure it is one of your top healing abilities. There are some instances where you would delay Cloudburst, for example if your Cloudburst will just overheal if you start ramping up now. In this scenario, delay your ramp up and DPS the&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/maximizing-cloudburst-totem/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/website/AEPblackwater-1024x576.jpg" loading="lazy" class="post__author-thumb" alt="niseko"> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/" class="feed__author invert">niseko</a> <time datetime="2018-04-16T01:19" class="feed__date">April 16, 2018</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/dpsing-as-a-healer/" class="invert">DPSing as a Healer</a></h2></header><div class="feed__image"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/dpsing-as-a-healer/"><img src="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/24/dpsingasahealer.jpg" srcset="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/24/responsive/dpsingasahealer-xs.jpg 300w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/24/responsive/dpsingasahealer-sm.jpg 480w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/24/responsive/dpsingasahealer-md.jpg 768w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/24/responsive/dpsingasahealer-lg.jpg 1024w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/24/responsive/dpsingasahealer-xl.jpg 1360w, https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/media/posts/24/responsive/dpsingasahealer-2xl.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" loading="lazy" height="720" width="1280" alt=""></a></div><div class="wrapper"><p>An incredibly common ideology among healers, especially shaman, is that their damage does not matter. While it is true that as resto shaman, we have lower damage than other healers, you should always try to maximize your damage in a progression environment. The smallest amounts of damage can make all of the difference when trying to down a boss for the first time. Whether it is pushing for earlier phase transition or attempting to beat a hard enrage, every small amount of damage can help. As a healer, you need to be able to identify when throwing casts into damage abilities will be the most efficient use of your time. This can be dependent on groups, content level and encounter. On most fights, you are generally safe to DPS on the pull. It is good to also identify periods of a boss fight where all required healing can easily be covered by incidental healing. Times like this are great to deal some additional damage, as your alternative is to spam Healing Wave on targets that do not need the healing. If mana is of no consequence, then your single target rotation will look like this: Keep Flame Shock up (Refresh when &lt;7 seconds)Use Lava Burst on CooldownUse Lightning Bolt as a fillerIf mana is of no consequence, then your 2 target rotation will look like this: Keep Flame Shock up on both targets (Refresh when &lt;7 seconds)Use Lava Burst on CooldownUse Chain Lightning as a fillerIf mana is of no consequence, then your 3+ target rotation will look like this: Keep Flame Shock up on up to 3 priority targets, no more or else you are letting it fall off (Refresh when &lt;7 seconds)Use any Lava Surge procsUse Chain Lightning as a fillerIf you find yourself struggling at all with mana, simply use Lightning Bolt.

I’m not going to go in-depth over every dungeon but I will make note of certain times where talents or legendaries are much better due in a particular dungeon. To begin, a quick rundown of how to heal in Mythic+ dungeons for a beginner. For most people talents are pretty rigid since we are focusing more on single target healing. Typical talent builds include these talents. 15 99.9% of the time you want to go with Undulation. The only time you should swap off this talent is if you are doing keys that are far below the difficulty your group is capable of. 30 Anything in this row works. A good choice is usually Gust of Wind since it can be used to access certain routes in dungeons that allow you to skip harder trash pulls or to dodge projectile mechanics. 45 Lightning Surge Totem is the default choice here since a 5 second AoE stun is very useful in almost any dungeon. You can also use Earthgrab Totem if your group wants an AoE root. 60 This row causes a lot of debate among Shamans. Crashing Waves is quite effective in Mythic+ due to the number of casts of riptides and maintaining high uptime on Tidal Waves. This will give you high output when single target healing. On the other hand, Ancestral Guidance is very strong when used in combination with Ascendance. You can easily top your group in 1-2 globals. Even when used alone, it still does a decent amount of healing and can allow you to DPS to heal. 75 Ancestral Vigor is the most widely used talent in this row since it is quite easy to apply it to all 5 group members before a large burst of damage as&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/mythic-keystone-dungeons/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><nav class="wrapper pagination desc"><div class="pagination__item"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/page/7/" class="readmore">Previous</a></div><div class="pagination__item"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/page/5/" class="readmore">Next </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></nav></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Footer Section</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
