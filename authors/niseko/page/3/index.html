The only major change on Mythic is the fact that Clouded Mind now always affects players, which means that the Shred Psyche add in phase 1 will only be visible by half the raid at a time. This also makes the Images of Absolution harder to deal with because only half of the raid can see the adds. To deal with this, each tank should have a marker on their head, and whichever one can see the Images of Absolution should become the 'safe area' for the raid to follow. Following that tank should prevent you from running into the adds if they aren't visible to you. Dealing with the Images of Absolution and dragging the Shred Psyche add away from the group is all that really occurs in phase 1, so you should try to save healing CD's if you can for phase 2. In Phase 2 Skitra will cast Illusionary Projection, spawning identical copies of the boss spread randomly around the edges of the room. Tanks should coordinate with one another using world markers to find the correct add to kill. Your group should be careful during this phase as it may require lots of movement and the Images of Absolution may still be present, so you need to make sure you're travelling as a group. If you have to travel a far distance Wind Rush Totem may be valuable. While the Illusionary Projections are alive, the raid will take increasing ticking damage because of Dark Ritual. This means that eventually the damage will become too much to heal through, so there is a time limit to getting out of this phase quickly.

Occasionally Maut will cast Devour Magic which will drop a silencing pool on the ground whenever the debuff falls off the player. These will be important later on when the boss casts Stygian Annihilation as it prevents the damage from the ability. On Mythic, the Devour Magic pools serve an additional purpose, as they can dispel the Ancient Curse that happens twice in each Phase 1. Periodically, Maut will also cast Black Wings which will knock back any player within 40 yards of the cone. Ranged can dodge this ability completely if they stand away from the boss opposite of the melee group, as the boss will always target the melee with it. After the 2nd Ancient Curse or about the time the boss casts the 3rd Black Wings, the add tank should drag a few of the adds into the boss to transition the boss into Phase 2. When Phase 2 begins, Maut will run to the center of the platform and cast Obsidian Skin, along with a long channeled ability called Obsidian Shatter. Obsidian Skin will reflect 100% of the damage you deal back into you, which can be very deadly for some classes. Your raid also needs to do enough damage to drain Maut's mana such that he has 0 mana left before the Obsidian Shatter cast finishes, thus it's a balancing act of dealing enough damage to beat the Obsidian Shatter cast, but not enough to outright kill yourself with Obsidian Skin. Additionally, Maut will occasionally put Drain Essence on 2 friendlies, who will need dispelled as soon as possible. While this phase does require an immense amount of healing, tanks will be soaking Forbidden Mana orbs periodically, allowing healers to gain&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/maut/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2020-04-12T00:40" class="feed__date">April 12, 2020</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/wrathion/" class="invert">Wrathion</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>Fight MechanicsWrathion is a 2 phase encounter that transitions between phase 1 and phase 2, separated by intermissions. On Mythic, players immediately start with Creeping Madness which will hinder the ability to move throughout the fight. You can safely stand still for most of Wrathion's abilities as a ranged, and even be far enough away so that Gale Blast will not affect you like it does the melee. Every so often he will cast Incineration on 3 random allies who need to run a bit away from the group to reduce the amount of damage you take. There are 2 Incineration casts per phase, and each phase is separated by about 3 minutes, so you can safely use raid-wide damage reductions like Spirit Link Totem on these abilities if you want. Occasionally the boss will cast Burning Cataclysm and you will need to move to the opposite side of the platform as his 'smoke cloud'. This is a great time to use Wind Rush Totem to allow the slower players to be able to reach the safe area in time. You will repeat these steps again before the boss transitions into his next phase. In Phase 2, three players will need to grab the Scales of Wrathion from under the boss and run through as many Crackling Shards as they can so the group can kill off as many as possible. Help kill some of the Crackling Shards that are far away from the boss so that the melee don't accidentally gain stacks from running back to Wrathion if he transitions back into Phase 1. A pretty standard talent setup is great for Wrathion, with the addition of Wind Rush Totem to help move your group during the intermissions. Earthen Wall Totem is quite good to place while everyone is&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/wrathion/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2020-04-10T20:00" class="feed__date">April 10, 2020</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/shadowlands-overview/" class="invert">Shadowlands Overview</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>Quick overview of the changes made to Restoration Shaman for Shadowlands. This article will be updated as Alpha and Beta progresses with the relevant information. None Learn about what Covenants are over on Wowhead: https://www.wowhead.com/guides/shadowlands-covenant-overview-abilities-rewards The gist of it is that this is the new system for Shadowlands, replacing stuff like Essences. You have to pick 1 of the covenants and are stuck with that choice from what we know at this time, meaning you can only use 1 of the ability sets listed below. Each Covenant gives you 1 signature and 1 class specific ability and Soulbinds, which is another Artifact / Azerite like system. As there isn't enough information about Soulbinds yet, they're omitted for now. All of the shaman abilities are hybrid, meaning you can use them to either deal damage, or to heal. Just a few examples of the 6 first known transmog sets in Shadowlands. Some of them are still missing either animations or pieces of armor, and there's different color variations.

In the first phase you are tasked with fighting Cyranus and Aethanel. These two mini bosses have mostly negligible mechanics from a healer perspective except for Cyranus's Charged Spear. During this phase you will also be tasked with killing Overzealous Hulks before they are able to drain the power of the Wards of Power. Azshara will also occasionally drain a Ward of Power at random around the room. To recharge these wards you can stand in them but you will gain a stack of Drained Soul. Avoid getting more than 5 or 6 stacks of Drained Soul if possible. Azshara will also occasionally cast Beckon which will always target 1 healer and 1 ranged damage dealer. In this phase, the beckon spawn point will always be near the middle of the room. Avoid being mind controlled by walking as far from the image of Azshara as possible (outside edge of the room) Azshara will also occasionally spawn Arcane Orb around the room that must be soaked fully or else they will deal heavy raid damage. Only one person needs to soak each orb. Lastly, Azshara will cast Divide and Conquer which will split the room in half on one of the two diagonals (front left to back right or front right to back left from the perspective of when you first zone in to the room). Once Cyranus and Aethanel are deafted, Queen Azshara will move into her first intermission. During this intermission you will be marked with two decrees and multiple arcane orb will spawn around the room. Simply obey the decrees you are given and make sure as a raid all the arcane orb are soaked.
