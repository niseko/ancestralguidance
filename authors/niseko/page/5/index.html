It should be noted, you cannot do normal pre-fight things such as eat food while underwater unless you use the Barnacle-Encrusted Gem so try to remember to get all of your buffs before you go underwater. The majority of the damage will come from Toxic Spine and being too close to other players via Bioelectric Feelers. There is one new addition to the fight on Mythic which is Piercing Barb, which will inflict 1.3million damage split between all players hit. If a player with an immunity gets this ability it is best that they get away from all other players and solo it as it will drastically reduce the amount of damage taken. Alternatively, you can have raid members help soak the Piercing Barb to split the damage done. Like Heroic, this boss has 3 platforms, however it is not required that you visit all 3 platforms to kill the boss Each Platform has 2 Shimmerskin Pufferfish which will explode into a Bioluminescent Cloud when killed, and players will need to swim into the cloud to remove Darkest Depths. Ground-placed spells and abilities are a bit of a hassle to use on this boss, so generally you want to avoid them if you can. I’d recommend Ancestral Vigor because of this, while otherwise using the 'standard' talent build. Spouting Spirits does still work underwater, and has a y-axis equal to roughly the diameter of the totem (picture the animation as a giant bubble). Having at least one Overflowing Shores may be useful, however, it's sometimes difficult to make use of Healing Rain on this encounter. Artifice of Time can actually see some use in this fight to help deal with Piercing Barb; having two healers use Artifice combined with external and personal DR’s, a person without an immunity is able to successfully solo Piercing Barb.

There are 3 main sources of damage: Frost Mark and Toxic Brand will ramp up over time and deal increasing ticking damage, and Unstable Mixture will deal damage when a person removes their stacks of either Frost Mark or Toxic Brand. To clear your stacks, you simply need to take the opposite form of damage (Frost players take Venom damage, and vice versa). This fight doesn’t really change much from Heroic aside from the numbers being much higher, however keeping the stacks of Frost Mark and Toxic Brand low will reduce the amount of damage your raid will take dramatically, so it’s recommended to clear your stacks around 4-5 so long as your raid is healthy. As the fight becomes more intense look to help your teammates who have Overflowing Chill or Overflowing Venom as they will need help soaking the damage. Lastly, the boss will always fire Overwhelming Barrage in the same order every time, so the tanks can face the boss towards the entrance of the room for the first Overwhelming Barrage, then towards the far (back) side of the room for the next, alternating between each Barrage so the raid takes less Unstable Mixture damage during the Overwhelming Barrage casts. This is our ‘standard’ talent build that we recommend, and nothing out of the ordinary changes in this fight so the standard build is great here. With the recent Wellspring buffs it is certainly viable to run Wellspring over High Tide, however there is no clear winner here, so pick what you’d prefer to play. Spouting Spirits and Overflowing Shores will provide a large amount of healing, however, it will be difficult to make use of Spouting Spirits full potential&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/abyssal-commander-sivara/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2019-06-25T23:35" class="feed__date">June 25, 2019</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/changes-in-82/" class="invert">Changes in 8.2</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>There is a lot of new content in 8.2, and it can be a lot to digest if you skimming through the various guides. So I’d like to cover some of the changes that are relevant to us to hopefully reduce the amount of info you may need to get through the patch. It’s worth noting, every crafted piece of gear no longer requires raid materials to make, however you will need to level up a ‘bench’ to upgrade your gear that requires some raid materials. Once you upgrade this, however, you are done completely on that character and never need the materials. Crafted gear is especially important because you can reroll them quite easily to obtain ideal stats + they all come with a socket (aside from Engineering, which is a 445 Azerite Helm). Leatherworking: You can create both Legs and Boots as the crafted gear, both of which have a socket on them and are very cheap to make aside from the new leather. Jewelcrafting: Similar to before, you get a new ring to make that has a socket on it. JC is very expensive though to unlock the 440 ring, so if you don’t want to throw a bunch of gold away into one piece of gear I’d consider something else, though this is arguably the best crafted piece to make. Alchemy: Same as before, you can get a pretty good Trinket fairly easily and it comes with a socket. It’s reliable, so it’s a safe profession to go with. Engineering: This is a great helm for “Battle Shaman” as it has IP on it, however the healing traits aren’t anything to get excited about (Turn of the Tide, and generic Engineering Traits). Further reading It is recommended to use a primary stat gem.

These can be changed like Talents, and are meant to be changed with the content you are doing to make the most use out of them. With 8.2 right around the corner I thought I’d try to do a quick write-up of what we thought about the new Essences while testing them. I’ll give a quick description of what each Essence does, give some Pros and Cons for each, where and how easy they are to obtain, and try to explain situations where each of them would be useful. Keep in mind, this is from the PTR and things could still change (there were changes as recent as the day before writing this) and I’d imagine numbers tuning may not be final until the start of Mythic. Also, at the bottom I’ll try to list which Major/Minor powers from each Essence will be useful for us in most scenarios. This is NOT a BIS list. Consider the pros and cons of each essence to determine which to use for now. Major: (3 minute CD) Creates a time vortex around a player absorbing 331,288 damage and healing for 6 seconds. When this expires, the absorbed damage and healing is delivered over 10 seconds and the damage is reduced by 20%. Minor: Your heals have a very high chance to grant the target 281 Haste and 281 Speed for 8 seconds. Pro: This is very similar to the Void Stone trinket we have from Crucible of Storms, but absorbing more damage/healing. This will probably be a nice pick in some M+ dungeons or in some niche situations in raid when you need to save a&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/heart-of-azeroth-essence-abilities/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2019-03-01T17:38" class="feed__date">March 1, 2019</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/lady-jaina-proudmoore/" class="invert">Lady Jaina Proudmoore</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>Fight MechanicsJaina is a three phase encounter with two intermissions. In Phase 1, you will be fighting Jaina on a boat where as a healer you are tasked with dispelling anyone who is afflicted by Grasp of Frost and Ring of Ice if people do not preposition themselves in the fire around the room. Try to avoid getting hit by Freezing Blast, take Avalanche out of the raid, and avoid getting hit by Bombard. When Jaina reaches 60% health remaining, she will transition into the first intermission where she causes the ship to crash into an iceberg and the fight continues by following her onto the iceberg. Jaina casts Howling Winds which restricts vision of her and will stop when interrupted. On Mythic difficulty, Jaina also summons 5 clones of herself that cast Howling Winds which need to be interrupted and killed before you can interrupt Jaina. Dodge the Blistering Tornadoes and Glacial Shards. Use Wind Rush Totem as you jump off the boat to increase the speed at which your raid runs and completes this phase to reduce the overall number of stacks of Chilling Touch applied. Once Jaina is interrupted, Phase 2 begins. The main mechanic of this phase is Chilling Touch. Chilling Touch stacks up over time dealing increased damage and applying an increasing slow. To remove stacks of Chilling Touch you will need to break open an Unexploded Ordnance. Around the room will be 3 Unexploded Ordnances that are encased in Refractive Ice reducing damage they take by 99%. You will want to break these open by dropping Broadside on them. Heal targets with Broadside as they will be taking a significant amount of added damage. When the Unexploded Ordnances are broken they will create an area that provides Warmth. After a few seconds these Ordnances&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/lady-jaina-proudmoore/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><nav class="wrapper pagination desc"><div class="pagination__item"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/page/6/" class="readmore">Previous</a></div><div class="pagination__item"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/page/4/" class="readmore">Next </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></nav></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Footer Section</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
