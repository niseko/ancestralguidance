With this fight being so healing intensive, I have created a video guide to accompany this written guide. Argus is a three phase encounter on Mythic difficulty. The first two of these phases largely are similar to the heroic version of this encounter with some slight tweaks due to the presence of Sargeras on the encounter space. The changes that Sargeras brings to the fight is two debuffs that you have to deal with as a whole raid, Sargeras’ Rage and Sargeras’ Fear. It is important to note that as a Restoration Shaman (since you are classified as a ranged), you cannot be targeted by Sargeras’ Rage for the first two casts of the ability. When you get Sargeras’ Fear, you need to be stacked with at least one other person to prevent getting Crushing Fear, a DoT that does around 350k each tick on a 0.5 sec tick rate. Watch out for people with Sargeras’ Rage as standing close to them will give you a DoT that does the same damage as getting a stack of the Fear DoT. Each time Sargeras casts this ability, either one rage will be added to the raid, or one fear depending on the cast number. Even casts add an extra Sargeras’ Fear, while odd casts add an extra Sargeras’ Rage. The first cast is one Sargeras’ Fear and one Sargeras’ Rage. This is where the healing intensive part of the fight begins. For Legendaries, there are many options. I recommend Velen’s Future Sight as the fight has many windows that it excels in. The other options are either Prydaz for more self sustain and allowing you to live through mistakes, Roots to help deal with DoT damage on yourself, Soul of the Farseer if you prefer&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/argus-the-unmaker-mythic/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2018-02-20T02:23" class="feed__date">February 20, 2018</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/battle-for-azeroth-alpha/" class="invert">Battle for Azeroth: Alpha</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>The Battle for Azeroth Alpha is now in full swing, but there still aren't many changes for Restoration Shaman. Let us look at what got changed nonetheless and what potential impact those changes could have on our playstyle. This post will be updated with every Alpha Patch - currently up to date for Build 26530 - May 02nd If you're interested in analyzing BFA Alpha logs, i updated https://bfa.wowanalyzer.com/ Wowhead recently added a new relevant piece: Community Opinions Regarding the Restoration Shaman Class Changes on Alpha The new allied races of the expansion also bring new totem designs, here are some of them! Replacing the artifact weapon with traits, Netherlight Crucible and also tier sets is a new system, called the Heart of Azeroth. There is not a lot of information on it yet, and a lof of the information we do have is based on speculation. However it looks like that if you pick a trait, you can not change it. How an azerite piece looks like: However some of the traits for Shaman have shown up in the alpha builds, keep in mind that all of the numbers are placeholders: Azerite Piece - Example Azerite piece, click on it to open the calculator Overall the changes feel unbalanced, taking away a lot of power and depth but not adding anything in as replacements. Keep in mind that a lot of our current interesting stuff is in the artifact, which haven't made it into the alpha (yet?), such as Obviously power has always be compared to other classes, and i don't doubt that they can tune us in a way where the throughput is not lacking, however my concerns are that we could feel bland and lose a lot of possible min-maxing.Mastery is still another concern, being severely behind the other stats&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/battle-for-azeroth-alpha/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2018-01-19T23:20" class="feed__date">January 19, 2018</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/how-to-maximize-cloudburst-totem/" class="invert">How to maximize Cloudburst Totem</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>Cloudburst Totem was first introduced in Warlords of Draenor and its current iteration is one of the strongest talents we could possibly have in our toolkit and it’s pretty much a set in stone talent, especially when the other options in that talent row are Echo of the Elements and Bottomless Depths. The totem absorbs 25% of the healing YOU do during its 15 seconds window and distributes it equally to all injured players on a 40 yard range of your character and not the totem. This is a question i see very often on our discord and decided to use this space to clear some things out. Your totems, such as Healing Tide Totem and Healing Stream Totem, will not feed into Cloudburst. The only exception is Tidal Totem, from a weapon trait called Tidal Pools, that does feed into it but it’s basically insignificant . With that out of the way, basically everything else will feed into Cloudburst. All of our spells, talents, trinkets and legendaries feed into Cloudburst. It’s also important to note that overheal feeds into Cloudburst so it is not just effective healing. Before 7.3, we used to be able to drop Cloudburst at the end of a cast, and that spell would feed into Cloudburst (just like you will see me pointing out about Ascendance and Ancestral Guidance, those still work) but that is no longer possible and ultimately changes nothing. You want to be using Cloudburst Totem on cooldown, in order to get maximum usage out of it. Doing so will ensure Cloudburst is one of your top healing abilities. There are some instances where you would delay Cloudburst, for example if your Cloudburst will just overheal if you start ramping up now. In this scenario, delay your ramp up and DPS the boss instead. It is important to use it as&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/how-to-maximize-cloudburst-totem/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2018-01-19T22:01" class="feed__date">January 19, 2018</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/aggramar-mythic/" class="invert">Aggramar Mythic</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>PRIMARY MECHANICSAggramar is the first of the two big scary red men you’ll be facing in Mythic Antorus. He has five total phases, three of which involve fighting Aggramar himself, while the other two are intermission phases where you fight adds. For Legendaries Prydaz or Roots with Velens will be the best combinations. Velens is almost mandatory since it is too strong with Ascendance and AG. The other legendary is only going to be used to counteract the ticking damage that happens throughout the fight. Prydaz will save you from large upfront hits, whereas roots will heal you though all the ticking damage. Save AG for Ascendance as the burst windows are the only scary parts of the fight. Spot heal people who are unfortunate enough to not dodge wake of flame. Use Healing Tide at the same time as Ascendance and Ancestral Guidance in the intermission to effectively solo 10-15 seconds of the intermission. In non intermission phases, keep Healing Rain on tanks and melee while spot healing with Healing Wave and Healing Surge.</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/aggramar-mythic/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2018-01-19T20:51" class="feed__date">January 19, 2018</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/the-coven-of-shivarra-mythic/" class="invert">The Coven of Shivarra Mythic</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>PRIMARY MECHANICSCoven is a seemingly complex encounter that actually ends up being rather simple in execution, with most mechanics beings very straightforward abilities that will cause burst spot healing or one-shot damage. Outside of the Storm of Darkness spawn zones, the timing of the abilities in the fight are scripted, so it is very easy to plan around them. The initial bosses spawned during the encounter are the same as heroic, with the Mother of Flames and Mother of Night being the active boss mobs. After these two titan abilities are cast, Mother of Flames will leave the encounter zone, and Mother of Gloom will become tankable. She will periodically drop frost orbs around the room that will slow movement (they don’t really do anything else). After about 40 seconds of not much happening, Mother of Night will switch with Mother of the Cosmos (the Mythic only Boss). Mother of the Cosmos requires consistent interrupts, and if needed you can assist in that job as a shaman (Melee are obviously more ideal). After dealing with the Machinations of Aman’thul, with this combination of bosses, Flames of Khaz’goroth and Spectral Army will be cast again - however there will be no Storm of Darkness, so they are significantly easier to deal with. After these occur, Mother of Gloom will switch with Mother of Flames, and you will burn down the boss from there (ignoring the Fury of Golganneth adds - stay spread! - and the second Machination of Aman’thul adds if they spawn). For legendaries, the only optimal options I see personally are Prydaz+Soul or Prydaz+Velens. If you want to skew your healing towards covering Storms/Aman’thul, run Velens. If you want to skew your healing towards Fulminating/Chilled Blood, run Soul. Prydaz as usual has some crazy one-shot prevention on this encounter and should likely never be unequipped here unless you are in some insane gear circumstance. I touched on most of the titan abilities above, but the key to this fight is simply being ready&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/the-coven-of-shivarra-mythic/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><nav class="wrapper pagination desc"><div class="pagination__item"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/page/14/" class="readmore">Previous</a></div><div class="pagination__item"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/page/12/" class="readmore">Next </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></nav></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Footer Section</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
