On Mythic the big change is every player that is hit by the Void Orb will spawn an Awakened Terror add that repeatedly casts Terror Wave that will fear everyone for 3 seconds if the cast completes. To avoid being feared, you should have a kick rotation set up for each of the 3 adds that spawn, with ranged kicks prioritizing the 2nd and 3rd adds as the boss will be too far away to allow melee to interrupt them right away. As for Void Ritual, there are 4 sets that will occur on Mythic, each of them will have the exact same pillar spawns each time. The only thing that changes is the position of the Void Orb spawn and the 'goal' may swap positions. It is also important to note that sets 1 and 4 are identical, so once your first group has successfully scored a goal it may be worthwhile to allow your fourth group to have a few tries to minimize wipes later on. All of the other mechanics such as Torment, Soul Flay, and the ticking damage from Anguish all remain from Heroic difficulty. A standard talent setup is fine for this fight. You may opt to use Wind Rush Totem if you feel your group needs help moving during Torment. Anguish and Soul Flay are the only real sources of damage on the fight, however the group will remain stacked up for most of the fight so typical traits such as Spouting Spirits, Overflowing Shores, Heart of Darkness, among others, are all fine for this fight. For essences, there is constant ticking damage so I'd recommend taking the Vision of Perfection major.Healing TipsÂ While the fight does require a fair&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/xanesh/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2020-04-12T00:43" class="feed__date">April 12, 2020</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/shadhar/" class="invert">Shad&#x27;har</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>Fight MechanicsThis is a 3 Phase encounter that phases at 67% and 33%. A few of the abilities such as Debilitating Spit and the Living Miasma add occur throughout the entire fight while some of the other mechanics are tied to a specific phase. If you are targetted by the Living Miasma add you will need to receive some sort of movement freeing ability like a Paladin's Freedom to allow you to position yourself away from the group to reduce the damage done by Slurry Outburst. Additionally on Mythic, the Slurry Outburst will spawn a Tasty Morsel that will need to be fed to Shad'har to reduce his Hungry stacks. If he reaches 10 stacks he will enrage, however not every player will need to feed on every Slurry Outburst. Generally, every other player will end up feeding Shad'har their Tasty Morsel. Also, the first player to get Debilitating Spit each cast will receive 4 stacks of it - this player will take a large amount of damage and will need some additional healing. In Phase 1 Shad'har will have access to Umbral Breath and Umbral Mantle. Throughout this phase Umbral Mantle will spawn random pools around the room that need to be dodged, and the frequency that these occur will gradually increase as the fight progresses, so it's important to try and get out of this phase quickly if you can. Umbral Breath will target a random player, so you should be evenly spread out around the room to prevent always having to move every time the breath is cast. When Phase 2 begins Shad'har will run to eat his Entropic Mantle which will gradually build up over time and give him access to Entropic Breath and Entropic Buildup. This is probably the hardest phase as Entropic Breath reduces&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/shadhar/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2020-04-12T00:43" class="feed__date">April 12, 2020</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/ra-den/" class="invert">Ra-den</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>Fight MechanicsThis is a 2 Phase encounter, but I'm going to break up Phase 1 into the different orb mechanics you'll be dealing with for each set of Essences that spawn. When an Essence is absorbed there are 3 different things that happen per essence: An add will spawn, there will be an initial burst of damage or healing absorb applied, and players will be affected by that Essences' mechanic which will need to be dealt with. Phase 1 - Kill Void, Absorb Nightmare and Vita: This is what most guilds opt to do for their 1st set of Essence spawns. When the boss absorbs Nightmare, players will need to be spread by 5 yards to avoid cleaving with Unleashed Nightmare, a Night Terror will spawn, and 5 stacks of Unstable Nightmare will affect a random player. The player with Unstable Nightmare will want to run close to melee so that melee can start rotating through the Unstable Nightmare mechanic. Additionally, Vita will be absorbed causing Unleashed Vita to do initial heavy damage, a Crackling Stalker to spawn, and Unstable Vita to affect a random player. The player with Unstable Vita should go to your designated first marker to allow the next person in the ranged group to take the next hit. Any players not dealing with either Unstable Nightmare or Unstable Vita need to be killing the Crackling Stalker &gt; Boss &gt; Night Terror. Phase 1 - Kill Vita, Absorb Nightmare and Void: This is what most guilds opt to do for their 2nd set of Essence spawns. The boss will again absorb Nightmare so the same mechanics will apply - the only change is that most groups opt to have their ranged deal with the Unstable Nightmare mechanic this time, as melee have a far easier time to&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/ra-den/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2020-04-12T00:43" class="feed__date">April 12, 2020</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/vexiona/" class="invert">Vexiona</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>Fight MechanicsThis is really a 2 phase encounter separated by intermissions. When the boss reaches 100 energy he will cast Twilight Decimator, causing him to breathe lethal damage onto 3 separate areas of the room (outer, middle, or inner/stairs). These areas run left and right, and Vexiona will always target a player with Twilight Decimator, meaning it's able to be baited. You should group up at one location and move to the next - we opted to start on the outside, move to inner/stairs, next to middle, and finally back to the outside because the breath does not completely disappear by the time the next one has begun, so this always gave us a 'safe' area to move to. Throughout the entire fight players will be affected by Encroaching Shadows and need to drop off pools - you should try to save as much room as possible early on. In Phase 1 there will be adds that spawn from the Dark Gateway casts, which also does some raid-wide damage. On Mythic the new add is the Enforcer, which repeatedly casts Brutal Smash, and grips players to him periodically. Brutal Smash does lethal damage, so you should avoid it if at all possible, and players who are gripped need to be ready to use their Ashjra'kamas, Shroud of Resolve to remove any movement slowing abilities they may receive. Despair is also present in Phase 1, which does AoE damage equal to the amount of missing health the tank has when it expires - this means the tank should be as close to 100% as possible when Despair expires to reduce damage taken. The Twilight Decimator intermissions happen roughly twice in the first phase. At 40% the boss will transition into the last phase, requiring players to be near another player to&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/vexiona/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2020-04-12T00:42" class="feed__date">April 12, 2020</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/hivemind/" class="invert">Hivemind</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>Fight MechanicsThe Hivemind is a 1 Phase encounter, however each boss will gain unique abilities whenever they control the Hivemind. Right away Tek'ris will gain control of the Hivemind by casting Tek'ris's Hivemind Control. This will do a large amount of raid-wide damage and require the bosses to be at least within 20 yards of each other. Additionally, any adds that spawn under Tek'ris's control will gain damage and movement speed every second that they're alive, so it's important to kill them quickly once they are stacked up to prevent running out of room due to the Acidic Blood they drop when killed. Both Echoing Void and Spawn Acidic Aqir happen throughout the fight regardless of who has control of the Hivemind, so it is important to properly spread or dodge these abilities when they're active. The bosses will swap control of the Hivemind roughly every 1:15 which will always cause heavy raid-wide damage, and this is what you should be saving your healing CD's for. When Ka'zir's Hivemind Control is cast, the bosses will need to be separated by at least 20 yards or they will reduce their damage taken by 99%. Additionally, any adds that are active during this time will heal for 3% of their health per second, so adds need to be focused down or else you will start to become overwhelmed. Ka'zir will also cast Mind-Numbing Nova throughout the fight that needs to be interrupted - shamans are excellent at this because Wind Shear has a low cooldown, however anyone is capable of doing this paired with whoever is tanking the boss. Ka'zir will also buff one of the adds and they will start a 20-second Volatile Eruption cast. This will deal heavy damage but will not overlap with the Devouring Frenzy damage, so unless&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/hivemind/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><nav class="wrapper pagination desc"><div class="pagination__item"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/page/3/" class="readmore">Previous</a></div><div class="pagination__item"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/" class="readmore">Next </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></nav></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Footer Section</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
