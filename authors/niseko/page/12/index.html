Crit currently performs slightly ahead of the pack, while Mastery lags slightly behind. You should gem and enchant Crit, and use the highest item level when gearing your character, adjusting with jewelry. The best way to begin is by reminding everyone, as mentioned before, that ALL OF OUR STATS ARE GOOD. In fact, having more of all of the stats makes them scale better yet. This is why, in Discord, you see the Ancestors, Ascendants and other regular users recommend a balance of secondary stats. If our stats are spread better, we are granted access to larger multipliers, and thus higher potential HPS numbers. Stats scale multiplicatively with each other following this formula (calculating averages for crit): Direct Heals: Intellect * Spell coefficient * (1+Effective-Mastery%) * (1+Crit%) * (1+Versatility%) Healing over Time: Intellect * Spell coefficient * (1+Effective-Mastery%) * (1+Crit%) * (1+Versatility%) * (1+Haste%) The biggest thing to note is that it is likely that you will never possess absolute equality regarding stats. Titan-forging and item level increases play a strong role in stat distribution. With item level increases being so strong for us, you are going to use the upgrade regardless of it messing up your beautiful secondary distribution that you worked so hard for. Another consideration is how stat weights may vary by encounter and by spell selection. Stat balance is important, but if you are truly wanting to get the most out of your stats, adjustments should be made based on what you’re seeing and what you need. So you understand the concept, I will use Mythic Maiden of Vigilance as an example. The Maiden encounter has constant ticking damage on a fairly stacked raid followed by periods of high raid-wide AoE damage.

Very powerful for low to moderate spot healing, and has the additional boon of being a passive and requiring no micro managing. Healing Wave and Healing Surge are our staple single target healing spells. This talent requires a bit of skill to learn how to effectively use the 50% healing increase properly. If you don’t track which cast you are on out of the three you can easily waste this buff. In most scenarios maximizing this has little gain but can be a life saver. You almost always want to use this spell in conjunction with a Chain Heal as it buffs all the bounces as well as the initial hit. While competitive with both other options, it requires the most management in the tier and needs to be used effectively and constantly to maintain its edge. It is useful for constant raid damage as well as short interval burst damage. It is important to note that Unleash Life can be used while in Ghost Wolf. Echo of the Elements provides many players with a nice quality of life buff, as having additional charges of abilities makes it less important to watch cooldowns like a hawk. Echo of the Elements allows you to effectively use your Riptides as well as Healing Stream Totems. This talent gains considerable power when combined with Cloudburst Totem. This talent has low impact on most encounters. Deluge assists with heavy stacked fights where a majority of your raid is in Healing Rain and you need to be consistently casting Chain Heals to keep up with the damage.

In Legion the talent saw great effectiveness in raiding and mythic+. In Battle for Azeroth the power of CBT has been lowered significantly due to the loss of AG as well as CBT replacing HST. Cloudburst Totem is now a good option for conserving mana when compared to other talents in tier 90. It also gained some flexibility due to Echo of the Elements being moved to tier 30 talents which enables us to have 2 charges of CBT. The totem absorbs 25% of the healing YOU do during its 15 seconds window and distributes it equally to all injured players on a 40 yard range of your character and not the totem. This is a question I see very often on our discord and decided to use this space to clear some things out. Your totems, such as Healing Tide Totem, will not feed into Cloudburst. This also means the Azerite traits like Swelling Streams, Ebb and Flow, and Sprouting Spirits will not feed Cloudburst. Currently Overflowing Shores also does not provide any feeding. Only healing done by restoration shaman abiltites will feed into Cloudburst including talents. It’s also important to note that overhealing feeds Cloudburst as well. You want to be using Cloudburst Totem on cooldown or close to it in order to get maximum usage out of it. Taking Echo of the Elements helps in not wasting casts of CBT during low damage portions of an encounter. Having high casts of Cloudburst will ensure it is one of your top healing abilities. There are some instances where you would delay Cloudburst, for example if your Cloudburst will just overheal if you start ramping up now. In this scenario, delay your ramp up and DPS the&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/maximizing-cloudburst-totem/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2018-04-16T01:19" class="feed__date">April 16, 2018</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/dpsing-as-a-healer/" class="invert">DPSing as a Healer</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>An incredibly common ideology among healers, especially shaman, is that their damage does not matter. While it is true that as resto shaman, we have lower damage than other healers, you should always try to maximize your damage in a progression environment. The smallest amounts of damage can make all of the difference when trying to down a boss for the first time. Whether it is pushing for earlier phase transition or attempting to beat a hard enrage, every small amount of damage can help. As a healer, you need to be able to identify when throwing casts into damage abilities will be the most efficient use of your time. This can be dependent on groups, content level and encounter. On most fights, you are generally safe to DPS on the pull. It is good to also identify periods of a boss fight where all required healing can easily be covered by incidental healing. Times like this are great to deal some additional damage, as your alternative is to spam Healing Wave on targets that do not need the healing. If mana is of no consequence, then your single target rotation will look like this: Keep Flame Shock up (Refresh when &lt;7 seconds)Use Lava Burst on CooldownUse Lightning Bolt as a fillerIf mana is of no consequence, then your 2 target rotation will look like this: Keep Flame Shock up on both targets (Refresh when &lt;7 seconds)Use Lava Burst on CooldownUse Chain Lightning as a fillerIf mana is of no consequence, then your 3+ target rotation will look like this: Keep Flame Shock up on up to 3 priority targets, no more or else you are letting it fall off (Refresh when &lt;7 seconds)Use any Lava Surge procsUse Chain Lightning as a fillerIf you find yourself struggling at all with mana, simply use Lightning Bolt.

I’m not going to go in-depth over every dungeon but I will make note of certain times where talents or legendaries are much better due in a particular dungeon. To begin, a quick rundown of how to heal in Mythic+ dungeons for a beginner. For most people talents are pretty rigid since we are focusing more on single target healing. Typical talent builds include these talents. 15 99.9% of the time you want to go with Undulation. The only time you should swap off this talent is if you are doing keys that are far below the difficulty your group is capable of. 30 Anything in this row works. A good choice is usually Gust of Wind since it can be used to access certain routes in dungeons that allow you to skip harder trash pulls or to dodge projectile mechanics. 45 Lightning Surge Totem is the default choice here since a 5 second AoE stun is very useful in almost any dungeon. You can also use Earthgrab Totem if your group wants an AoE root. 60 This row causes a lot of debate among Shamans. Crashing Waves is quite effective in Mythic+ due to the number of casts of riptides and maintaining high uptime on Tidal Waves. This will give you high output when single target healing. On the other hand, Ancestral Guidance is very strong when used in combination with Ascendance. You can easily top your group in 1-2 globals. Even when used alone, it still does a decent amount of healing and can allow you to DPS to heal. 75 Ancestral Vigor is the most widely used talent in this row since it is quite easy to apply it to all 5 group members before a large burst of damage as&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/mythic-keystone-dungeons/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><nav class="wrapper pagination desc"><div class="pagination__item"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/page/13/" class="readmore">Previous</a></div><div class="pagination__item"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/page/11/" class="readmore">Next </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></nav></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Footer Section</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
