The only consistent raid damage is from the tank's Rising Flames stacks expire. Other than that, there are spikes of raidwide damage during each of the boss's special abilities. The first, Fire of the Mist causes three living bombs to spawn around the room shrouded in mist that explode every few seconds. You will likely want to use multiple raid cooldowns during this as your raid will be constantly moving from bomb to bomb with line of sight issues caused by the mist around each of the bombs. The second special ability is A Flash of Hostility which will spawn a maze made up of Ring of Peace. During this, there will be constant raid damage until the Barrier seperating the bosses from the raid is killed. You will want at least one healing cooldown while the raid is moving to the barrier. The final special ability is The Serpent and the Phoenix which the causes the bosses to turn into a dragon and a phoenix. There is constant AoE damage as long as the phoenix lives. Try to not step in Magma Traps as a shaman since we have no way to stop ourselves from dying to falling damage. Make sure you dispel Searing Embers before it expires as it will cause a large amount of raid damage. On mythic difficulty, when the monk boss casts Multi-Sided Strike, you will likely go up in the air and have to look at 5 monk spirits in the following order: Blue, Green, Red, Green, Blue. You could consider taking Ascendance over HT since this fight has no real sustained damage until the bosses reach 100 energy which is at the very end of the fight.

Depending on Faction you'll see different names for the same abilities and they'll be listed as Horde / Alliance. This is a fight filled with constant raidwide AoE damage while also having high tank damage. Every form of raidwide damage in this encounter is done in large chunks. The first of which is Grong's Ferocious Roar. Make sure you are standing near one other player when Grong casts Ferocious Roar to not get feared. In Mythic, the fear turns to a horrify which means Tremor Totem has no use. Next, after each Bestial Combo, Grong will cast Bestial Throw which deals raid damage that decreases with distance the throw is from the boss. If you are targeted by the throw, run away from your raid members so they don't get hit by the impact, but more importantly run away from Grong to reduce overall raid damage. Grong's final raid damage ability is Reverberating Slam which targets a melee and does damage in a large area around that melee player. More than likely, every melee player will be hit by this mechanic so they will need to be healed. After the slam, a Reverberating Echo will happen a few seconds later. Do not stand in the Reverberating Echo. Ranged players will be targeted by Megatomic Seeker Missles / Voodoo Blasts. Move quickly out of the fire on the ground caused by these mechanics. Lastly, when Grong reaches full energy or when triggered by using a Apetagonizer Core / Necrotic Core, he will cast Tantrum / Death Knell. For each 25 energy Grong has, he will deal a large amount of raid damage and leave a stack of Shattered / Death Touched. This causes your raid to always be taking a small amount of damage&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/grong/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2019-03-01T17:30" class="feed__date">March 1, 2019</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/champion-of-the-light/" class="invert">Champion of the Light</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>Fight MechanicsWhile Champion of the Light is the first encounter in Battle of Dazar'alor, there are a few key mechanics to look out for as a healer. There is raid wide damage every time the boss melees during Seal of Retribution. Use AoE healing spells frequently to combat this. Also the tank who is tanking the main boss will be taking increased damage over time from Sacred Blade, make sure to keep an eye on this tank as you are healing the raid. When Seal of Retribution ends and Seal of Reckoning begins the constant raid damage will cease. Any damage done to the boss from a target without Sacred Blade will cause the boss to gains stacks of Zealotry. When all the adds are defeated or when the boss reaches full energy, the boss will cast Judgement: Reckoning which you will want to use defensive cooldowns for. Lastly, the boss will periodically cast Wave of Light. Make sure to dispel anyone who is hit by the wave as it deals a large amount of damage over time. Once the boss hits 30% health, it will cast Avenging Wrath, increasing its damage by 30%. On mythic difficulty, the boss will also cast Prayer for the Fallen. During this cast any Disciple adds, and their ghosts will need to be interrupted, use Wind Shear to prevent them from healing the boss to full health. Also the Crusader adds will cast Divine Mallet which sends out a spiral of hammers in four directions that deal damage on contact with players. Due to the constant raid damage present during most off the encounter EWT and HT are recommended. You could drop CBT in favor of Downpour as they will perform similarly throughput wise, but CBT is one less global and slightly more efficient&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/champion-of-the-light/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2018-12-11T01:35" class="feed__date">December 11, 2018</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/changes-in-81/" class="invert">Changes in 8.1</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>Spell and Talent ChangesIn patch 8.1, Tides of Vengeance, Chain Heal is being buffed by 33.3%. This change brings Chain Heal back into relevancy for raid healing for all talent builds. Along with this buff to Chain Heal, High Tide has received a rework. High Tide no longer adds an additional bounce to Chain Heal while also reducing bounce falloff. Instead, upon spending 40,000 mana, you will gain two charges of High Tide. These charges are consumed on your next two casts of Chain Heal increasing the healing of that Chain Heal by 20% and causing it to have no bounce falloff. This means all bounces of Chain Heal will heal for the same base amount and they are all buffed by 20%. In addition, Unleash Life is receiving changes as well. The upfront healing of Unleash Life is being increased by about 18%. To counterbalance this change, the increased healing on your next healing spell is being reduced from an increase of 45% to 35%. This change is pretty much overall neutral and makes sense when considering the potential of Unleash Life with the new High Tide. The increased upfront healing also means the opportunity cost of using Unleash Life is much lower since it heals for slightly less than a Healing Surge. Overall when you add the spellpower from Unleash Life with the spell it buffed, there is almost no change in the total spellpower (slightly favoring the 8.1 version) when used on Healing Wave, Healing Surge, and Riptide. Chain Heal gains more from the 8.1 changes due to the 33.3% buff which outweighs the difference in the Unleash Life change. The total effectiveness of UnL + CH in patch 8.1 yields a gain of around 20% spellpower when UnL is used on a CH in comparison to their 8.0&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/changes-in-81/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2018-10-14T03:30" class="feed__date">October 14, 2018</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/restoration-shaman-spreadsheet/" class="invert">Restoration Shaman Spreadsheet</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>Ancestral Guidance The Restoration Shaman Spreadsheet Create a copy by clicking the link in the Info Box in the top right. Alternatively use this link. Your own copy of the Spreadsheet gives you access to a lot of different tools, with an estimation of stat weights based on logs – such as Azerite Gear Comparison, trinket estimations and weapon enchant information. All this is based on log information giving you stat weights, and some look at how much you use certain abilities (Overflowing Shores is directly linked to your Healing Rain casts). The data that's already in the spreadsheet is based off of logs of various mythic kills of the members of Ancestral Guidance, trying to get a healthy balance of different types of bosses and players. Inserting your own information will personalize this data to how you play. The Data that's most useful are progress kills as they usually involve you trying your best and not cheesing anything – using fights where you actually have something to heal is good as well, since having a lot of downtime can screw with the results. Now that you have a log selected, visit WoWAnalyzer and paste your combatlog URL into the box.
