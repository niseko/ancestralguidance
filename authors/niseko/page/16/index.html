I would recommend glancing over the dungeon journal for the details of the minor abilities. Below I will be touching on the combos/abilities that will likely cause issues for groups that are struggling with the boss. For Legendaries any combination of Prydaz/Velens/Roots/Soul can be used on this encounter depending on your gear (likely the setup that gives you the best itemization will end up performing the best for you here). If all else is equal, since the fight includes a lot of random snap damage, Prydaz is extremely valuable, and the choice between the others will most likely come down to personal preference. This fight is all about group coordination, and for much of the encounter it may feel like you are healing a 10 man raid (you will likely be in range of both groups quite often, but it may not always be the case). It’s very important to have CBT rolling into every 100 energy ability from either dog (matching color or not). This requires decent energy tracking of both dogs (yes you can get essentially all of them if you play on point) - I would recommend finding a good energy weakaura if you are concerned about the encounter. SLT should be saved for when you get Flametouched, as moving as a group for Siphon with SLT up essentially prevents any and all deaths during its duration, even with multiple mistakes.</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/felhounds-of-sargeras-mythic/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2017-12-22T06:20" class="feed__date">December 22, 2017</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/garothi-worldbreaker-mythic/" class="invert">Garothi Worldbreaker Mythic</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>PRIMARY MECHANICSDecimation - This is the primary “AoE damage” ability of the encounter, and will be the ability that you will want to center your healing around. This ability targets six members of the raid and after a few seconds spawns a targeting circle under their feet. Moments later, a barrage of missiles will hit at the targeted location, dealing (likely lethal) damage to anyone standing inside, as well as unavoidable AoE damage to the raid.After destroying the Decimator during Apocalypse Drive, this ability will stun its 6 targets for a few seconds - preventing them from running out of the group with the targeting circles. Simply have the raid stack and move as a group for this after the empowerment.Annihilation - The soaking mechanic that we all grew to love (not so much) in ToS makes another debut here. The boss will simply shoot missiles into the air that create green circles on the ground when they land.After destroying the Annihilator during Apocalypse Drive, this ability will knock back anyone who soaks the missiles on the ground. After the initial soak, a fel crater will form, which will ALSO need to be soaked by either the same player (using a displacement or immunity) or another nearby player. The best way to handle this is to have your members pair off on the fly, or to simply have players that soak attempt to get knocked towards a crater after the initial hit.Apocalypse Drive - This is the intermission phase of the fight, and it simply requires you to dodge the green blasts on the ground until either the Decimator or Annihilator is destroyed (The easiest tactic is generally to kill the Decimator on the first Apocalypse Drive, and the Annihilator on the second). Once a weapon is destroyed, its respective ability will become&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/garothi-worldbreaker-mythic/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2017-12-22T01:50" class="feed__date">December 22, 2017</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/playstyle-changes-for-antorus/" class="invert">Playstyle Changes for Antorus</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>Now that Antorus, the Burning Throne has been released, it’s important to talk about the state of restoration shaman as well as any changes to our playstyle. While there has been no changes to the base toolkit of restoration shamans going into Antorus, our new set bonuses impact our play drastically and present an extra skill cap to achieve in order to master your restoration shaman. Before we jump into details about the shift to our play style, let’s first cover what exactly our set bonuses do. The Tier 21 set, the Garb of Venerated Spirits, has a heavy influence on Healing Rain placement and timings.The 2 piece bonus provides an initial heal on up to 6 allies within the Healing Rain reticle when a cast is completed. This heals for 225% of spell power and scales off versatility and can critically strike. The healing produced by this bonus is called Rainfall. It is important to note that mastery does NOT have any effect on Rainfall. You can think of this bonus as whenever you cast Healing Rain, a Chain Heal’s worth of healing is divided amongst 6 targets in the area. The 4 piece bonus provides an alternative method of doing spot healing to multiple targets at the same time while being mana efficient. Everytime you cast Healing Wave or Healing Surge, an ally in your Healing Rain will be healed for 40% of the healing done by the Healing Wave or Healing Surge. The healing produced by this bonus is called Downpour. This bonus, like the 2 piece, does NOT scale with mastery on its own. Since the Healing Wave or Healing Surge does scale with mastery, the Downpour healing is calculated off the amount done therefore already has mastery scaling built in. Now this is where things get awkward.

Crit currently performs slightly ahead of the pack, while Mastery lags slightly behind. You should gem and enchant Crit, enchant Mark of the Ancient Priestess, and use the highest item level when gearing your character, adjusting with jewelry. The best way to begin is by reminding everyone, as mentioned before, that ALL OF OUR STATS ARE GOOD. In fact, having more of all of the stats makes them scale better yet. This is why, in Discord, you see the Ancestors, Ascendants and other regular users recommend a balance of secondary stats. If our stats are spread better, we are granted access to larger multipliers, and thus higher potential HPS numbers. Stats scale multiplicatively with each other following this formula: Direct Heals: Intellect * Artifact Weapon Multipliers * Spell coefficient * Effective-Mastery% * Crit% * Versatility% Healing over Time: Intellect * Artifact Weapon Multipliers * Spell coefficient * Effective-Mastery% * Crit% * Versatility% * Haste% The biggest thing to note is that it is likely that you will never possess absolute equality regarding stats. Titan-forging and item level increases play a strong role in stat distribution. With item level increases being so strong for us, you are going to use the upgrade regardless of it messing up your beautiful secondary distribution that you worked so hard for. Another consideration is how stat weights may vary by encounter and by spell selection. Stat balance is important, but if you are truly wanting to get the most out of your stats, adjustments should be made based on what you’re seeing and what you need. So you understand the concept, I will use Mythic Maiden of Vigilance as an example. The Maiden encounter has constant ticking damage on a fairly stacked&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/stats-and-where-to-find-them/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2017-12-21T18:03" class="feed__date">December 21, 2017</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assigning-healing-cooldowns/" class="invert">Assigning Healing Cooldowns</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>When going into an encounter, one of the first things to do is to set up optimal healer cooldowns in your raid such that you can conserve mana and live through high raidwide damage periods. When setting these cooldowns up, it is important to look at what healers you are bringing to an encounter as well as whether the fight has lots of burst damage or sustained damage. To start, let’s go over all the healing cooldowns in the game class by class and where these abilities excel. Restoration Shaman Mistweaver Monk Holy Paladin Discipline Priest Holy Priest Restoration Druid Restoration Shaman Mistweaver Monk Holy Paladin Discipline Priest Holy Priest Restoration Druid As you can see, every class has their own large healing cooldown that is typically on a longer cooldown but has a large impact on overall raid healing. Most of these large healing cooldowns also heal over time or have longer duration windows in which the healing is spread over. These abilities are the ones that you will want to sync up with large pulses of raid damage or ticking damage. Most classes also have shorter cooldowns that are quite effective at taking care of small chip damage that happens throughout an encounter. Most of these small cooldowns synergize extremely well with Velen’s Future Sight since the cooldowns mostly line up with the trinket’s cooldown and increase the effectiveness of these small cooldowns into something significant. Shaman cooldowns are by far the most versatile since they all scale off our mastery which increases their throughput massively during critical periods of damage. The most flexible of our cooldowns is easily Ancestral Guidance (AG). On a two minute cooldown, it essentially replicates 60% of the healing you do and spreads it evenly across three targets. This healing feeds into cloudburst totem and ancestral guidance will then replicate the&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assigning-healing-cooldowns/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><nav class="wrapper pagination desc"><div class="pagination__item"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/page/17/" class="readmore">Previous</a></div><div class="pagination__item"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/page/15/" class="readmore">Next </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></nav></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Footer Section</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
