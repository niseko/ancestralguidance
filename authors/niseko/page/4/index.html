Za'qul starts out only having a few abilities. Za'qul occasionally casts Tentacles which spawns a tentacle somewhere on the outside of the room then spawns 2 more (counter clockwise to the first spawn). These tentacles shoot out in a straight line across the circle from their spawn point and will knockback any players in the line as well as do heavy damage (generally lethal). Za'qul will also spawn 3 Horrific Summoners as long as at least 1 player is in the normal realm. The last ability Za'qul has is Dread. Dread causes 4 raid members to run in fear and deals heavy raid wide damage when dispelled. Upon reaching 85% health, Za'qul opens the Fear Realm and drags the entire raid into the Fear Realm. While in the Fear Realm, all players inside gain a stack of Hysteria every 15 seconds. Za'qul also will mark two raid members with Manifest Nightmares which deals heavy periodic damage over a few seconds and leaves a Nightmare Pool near the afflicted player's feet every tick. Upon expiration a Horrific Vision will spawn from each player. The last mechanic, Maddening Eruption will kill you if you are stood in it when it goes off. For 20 seconds after the Maddening Eruption goes off, Za'qul takes 30% more damage. When Za'qul reaches 70% health, he will open the Delirium Realm. This realm is mostly for DPS players as any player who enters the Delirium Realm will be hostile to all other players within the realm. As a healer, the only things to worry about is to not go into the Delirium Realm (don't stand in the orange eye balls of the floor), and dispel people who&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/zaqul/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2019-09-16T20:05" class="feed__date">September 16, 2019</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/queens-court/" class="invert">Queen&#x27;s Court</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>Fight MechanicsThe Queen's Court is the sixth boss in The Eternal Palace. It is similar to Heroic with the added mechanic of Sphere of Influence on Mythic difficulty, causing you to kite both bosses around the room in a clockwise motion. Like heroic, the majority of the damage comes from Form Ranks and Potent Spark, making those overlaps very difficult to deal with. Tanks should always keep the bosses at least 21 yards apart due to Separation of Power, as any time they are too close will result in a huge damage loss, making the already tight enrage even harder. The raid will have to deal with several Decrees throughout the fight; it's important you know which decree is active so you can deal with each of them effectively. Silivaz will occasionally use Frenetic Charge at a player, which will deal heavy split damage, so the raid should help the player soak the damage unless Stand Alone is currently active. During the Frenetic Charge and Stand Alone overlap, you can use external damage reductions, immunities, or simply opt to sacrifice the player with Frenetic Charge to avoid a large amount of damage caused by Stand Alone. Silivaz will also cast Zealous Eruption, and you must make sure to be inside of the bubble as it does an incredible amount of damage and will almost certainly kill you. Again, this is dangerous while Stand Alone is active, so be weary of people around you. Pashmar occasionally targets players with Fanatical Verdict, which will deal a large amount of damage, so players should try to avoid soaking other forms of damage if possible. Make sure you aren't inside Violent Outburst when it is finished casting. Lastly Pashmar will summon Potent Sparks, which will slowly die on their own, and when killed will&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/queens-court/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2019-09-16T20:04" class="feed__date">September 16, 2019</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/orgozoa/" class="invert">Orgozoa</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>Fight MechanicsOrgozoa is the fifth boss in The Eternal Palace, and is another 2 phase encounter. This fight is also similar to heroic, the major change is Arcing Current, which causes players with Incubation Fluid to spread it to other nearby players, so they will need to get away from the group. The first minute of this fight has almost no damage, so healers should be adding in as much damage as possible during this time. Tanks will still take a very large amount of damage if they do not have any Desensitizing Sting stacks, so if they are about to swap they need to have some sort of active mitigation. This is another fight where 3 tanking can make the fight easier, as one tank solely focuses on grabbing the adds and stacking them together while the other two tanks focus on the boss. Players should find safe areas to stand during Dribbling Ichor to avoid taking a large amount of damage. There are times when Amniotic Splatter soaks overlap with Dribbling Ichor, so it may be smart to use an immunity of some sort to soak the Amniotic Splatter. Players with Incubation Fluid will need to spread out on every Arcing Current cast to avoid chaining Incubation Fluid to the entire raid. While the Zoatroids are alive, they will cast Pervasive Shock, inflicting a good amount of AoE damage to the raid; this on top of the Incubation Fluid DoT will force healers to chain healing CD’s during the later parts of each phase. Once the boss phases at 40% all players lose their Incubation Fluid debuffs and the intermission begins; you have enough time to use no movement speed increases and walk down the ramp before the cast needs to be kicked, so you should play it safe and avoid getting&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/orgozoa/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2019-09-16T20:03" class="feed__date">September 16, 2019</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/lady-ashvane/" class="invert">Lady Ashvane</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>Fight MechanicsLady Ashvane is the fourth boss in The Eternal Palace, and is the first real “wall” of the instance. It is a 2 phase encounter that rotates between the phases (1-2-1-2, etc). There is a tight dps check on this fight so most guilds opt to use only 3 healers to ensure they will have enough damage to kill the boss before the boss casts his third Hardened Carapace. This boss will require excellent CD timings for both healers and DPS, as you want to maximize the amount of damage you’re dealing during the burn phases. The most common strategy for this encounter is to use a third tank as a ‘sacrificial lamb’ to soak a large majority of the Rippling Wave bubbles. Doing this will lower the raid damage taken by a very large amount, making it much easier to 3 heal. Throughout the fight 3 players will get affected by Briny Bubble, and should stack on top of each other outside of the group so they can get cleaved down quickly; these players will require extra healing while they’re inside the bubble (it is worth noting you are able to immune the bubbles to dodge the mechanic). These sometimes overlap with Upsurge, which can very easily kill players who have taken other sources of damage. Coral Growths will also spawn throughout the encounter, and tanks should try to position the boss in such a way that it won’t be right on top of the Coral Growths, otherwise it will be very hard to soak the Rippling Waves that spawn from it. The third tank should aim to soak every Rippling Wave possible while the boss has an active Hardened Carapace, otherwise it will replenish the Hardened Carapace, probably resulting in a wipe.

This fight is arguably the easiest of the first 3 bosses as it is very similar to heroic and the only added mechanic is very easy to deal with. Every ~18 seconds the raid will take a heavy burst of damage from Unshackled Power, which is the primary form of damage in this fight. On Mythic, one additional add is spawned during the intermissions, so you will need to split your raid in half once it is time for the Intermission. Similar to Heroic, healers will need to dispel players with Arcane Bomb once the player is in a safe location. Everyone should aim to dodge the tornadoes spawned by Arcanado Burst as it is completely avoidable damage. During the Intermissions the tank can pull the Stormwraith towards the edge of the Ancient Tempest so Gale Buffet wont knock you out of the circle. Alternatively, you can have your back up against the entrance stairs so you are instead knocked into them and avoid being displaced by the knockback. DPS and tanks should rotate kicks on the Stormling’s Chain Lightnings to avoid extra damage. This fairly ‘standard’ talent setup is great for this boss, especially because you’ll be splitting your raid in half, meaning you would be unable to make great use of Wellspring and Ascendance throughout the entire encounter. Wind Rush Totem can be used at the start of intermission to help your group move through the Squall Traps a bit easier. Spouting Spirits and Overflowing Shores will provide a large amount of healing, especially if you can get the majority of the raid to stack up when you use your Spirit Link.
