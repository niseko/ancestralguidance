Guilds will ether 4 heal the boss, splitting the raid into three groups of 9/9/2 warlocks, or they will 5 heal, splitting the raid similarly, but not forcing the 2 warlocks requirement, as there will be an extra healer for the small group on the last robot. There are also generally 2 robot kill orders used, with the final robot kill order going Red-&gt;Red-&gt;Purple-&gt;Red or Red-&gt;Purple-&gt;Red-&gt;Red. Regardless of your guild’s strategy, your approach to the fight as a shaman should remain about the same. In Kin'garoth's primary active phase, there are only three major abilities that affect non-tanks (please don't stand on your tanks): For Legendaries any combination of Prydaz/Velens/Roots/Soul can be used on this encounter depending on your gear (likely the setup that gives you the best itemization will end up performing the best for you here). If all else is equal, Prydaz will help smooth incoming burst damage if you get targeted by Reverberating Strike at the same time a Diabolic Bomb is being popped. If you can consistently get good Chain Heal value, Soul drastically loses value. As I noted on the mechanics tab, try to adjust assignments during Apocalypse Protocol so your group has as many melee DPS as possible. The AoE damage during these phases get extremely high as the boss gains increased damage done during the encounter, and allowing your tier and Healing Rain to get maximum value make healing the phase significantly easier. Apocalypse Protocol phases are almost exactly 2 minutes apart, so if you are struggling with healing during these phases, note that you can simply avoid using AG and SWG during the first active phase and then proceed to save those CDs for every construction phase of&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/kingaroth-mythic/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2017-12-23T12:10" class="feed__date">December 23, 2017</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/imonar-the-soulhunter-mythic/" class="invert">Imonar the Soulhunter Mythic</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>PRIMARY MECHANICSInstead of touching on the mechanics individually on this fight, I’ll overview how to approach the fight in a section by section overview. The most important aspect of this encounter is your approach to the obstacle course gauntlet of traps/bombs/mines. There are two different style gauntlets during the fight, the first is the path that involves Imonar dropping the green runes and green knockback mines - Pulse Grenades and Stasis Traps, and the second involving the red tripwires and red frag mines - Blastwire and Shrapnel Blast. These gauntlets alternate, and will happen roughly 1:30 apart for progressing guilds. The phases of the boss where you can actually hit Imonar are significantly easier in comparison, and generally involve dispelling sleep canister when there are no nearby players, and aiming the targeted lasers from the nearby ships away from the raid - Charged Blasts. For Legendaries Prydaz/Velens is usually the best combo for this one, unless you aren’t taking care of the burst healing at the start of transition 2/4. If that is the case Roots/Soul are also good options to consider if they improve your gear standing, but due to the nature of the fight Prydaz/Velens will usually give the most meaningful boost to performance. When approaching the start of transitions 2 and 4, make sure you begin placing your healing down at the edge of the bridge a few percent before the boss phases. As the first tripwires are being placed, you will want your CBT, HTT, and Healing Rain already placed, before popping SLT and AG/Asc/Velens. A Shaman can essentially solo carry that phase, relieving a lot of the burst healing stress from your other healers. When running through transitions 1 and 3, make sure you’re always aware of who has Empowered Pulse Grenade and where they are located behind the raid. If you’re not targeted, make sure when you get to the end of the bridge before them,&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/imonar-the-soulhunter-mythic/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2017-12-23T12:06" class="feed__date">December 23, 2017</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/eonar-the-lifebinder-mythic/" class="invert">Eonar the Lifebinder Mythic</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>PRIMARY MECHANICSEonar just wants to be left alone, but all these rude guys just want to get up in her grill. It’s your job to slap them away. To be honest there are TONS of ways to do this boss, and 90% of the time you simply need to stick to your assigned group and traverse through the fight as mobs spawn around the zone. As a healer you will almost always be assigned to handling one of the Paraxis groups, and you will also likely pick up the yellow debuff. This debuff will cause damage to you for any movement you make, and stacks the more you move. Simply just try to remain stationary as much as possible to reduce the impact of this ability while you continue to handle your group assignments. To be honest you can take literally any talent setup and complete any assignment you are given within reason. Most of your selections should just be made based on that/where you are assigned and who you are with. I highly recommend Lightning Surge Totem on the small waves of adds. Roots/Prydaz/Velens/Soul are the good choices here, but to be honest if you’re standing in the places you’re supposed to be standing you can rock bracers/belt and still be falling asleep the whole fight. Really the only tips to give for this fight is that if you quickly tap your “W” key with the yellow debuff you can inch in a direction without stacking up your movement debuff. You also don’t stack up the debuff while flying in a straight line with your extra action button.</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/eonar-the-lifebinder-mythic/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2017-12-22T16:48" class="feed__date">December 22, 2017</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/portal-keeper-hasabel-mythic/" class="invert">Portal Keeper Hasabel Mythic</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>PRIMARY MECHANICSAs a shaman you can be assigned two different jobs on this boss, as you can both comfortably heal the downstairs platform as well as heal the upstairs groups. The downstairs healing job is extremely easy, and there are essentially no changes from heroic other than the difference in damage taken to the raid. I won’t touch too much on the downstairs healing job, as there is little to do other than drop CBT for every collapsing world (which once again happens to be on a 30-32 second cooldown). The only real note to healing downstairs is to make sure you utilize Lightning Surge Totem and Wind Shear as much as possible when your portal team is upstairs in order to minimize risk of wipes to the mismanagement of imps. Healing CDs should also be used while the portal team is upstairs, as you will be taking extra AoE damage downstairs while also being down a healer. If you are assigned to the portals as a shaman, congrats on being the mechanic bitch for the fight - on the plus side it probably means your raid leader doesn’t think you’re completely inept. For Legendaries while healing downstairs, any combination of Prydaz/Velens/Roots/Fire can be used on this encounter depending on your gear (likely the setup that gives you the best itemization will end up performing the best for you here). If you’re healing portals, Prydaz/Velens/Roots/Soul are all good choices, with soul pulling ahead in smaller portal groups, and falling behind in larger ones. The portals were detailed pretty heavily before, but overall this is yet another fight that CBT timing is an extremely important part of your play. Getting strong CBTs in conjunction with collapsing world will greatly help smooth out the damage curve of the encounter. I will also reiterate the importance of using Lightning Surge and Wind Shear throughout the fight, whether it involves kicking and&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/portal-keeper-hasabel-mythic/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2017-12-22T16:23" class="feed__date">December 22, 2017</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/antoran-high-command-mythic/" class="invert">Antoran High Command Mythic</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>PRIMARY MECHANICSAntoran High Command is a three boss encounter, however the fight does not change too much from boss to boss. There are essentially only four major abilities that affect the raid - three of which are active at a time. For ease I will be describing the boss simply by which boss is active in numbered order, eg. Boss 1/2/3. For Legendaries any combination of Prydaz/Velens/Roots can be used on this encounter depending on your gear (likely the setup that gives you the best itemization will end up performing the best for you here). There can be arguments made for Fire in the Deep if it works with your gear really well since the raid is stacked quite often. If your raid is constantly struggling to keep up the players targeted by Shock Grenade, Soul of the Farseer can be considered as well, but it is not ideal for this one overall. It is extremely important to time your CBT with the first Fusillade properly, as you will have VERY little leeway to adjust your drop timing if you drop it too late on the first one. Go out of your way to stare at that timer, and note that bigwigs has a timer that counts to the START of the Fusillade cast, that is then followed by another 10 second timer for the impact (as of the current build - always subject to change at a moment’s notice). Because of the sheer volume of damage during this fight it’s extremely important to coordinate healing CDs with your teammates to prevent overlapping and potential waste. If your raid is struggling to keep up with the AoE damage of the Entropic mines, try to get your inactive tank to pop extra mines as the Fusillade Shield goes up on the raid, to get the extra DR it provides.
