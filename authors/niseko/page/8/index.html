Heroic Guide The mythic version of G'huun introduces two new mechanics and has some changes to the mechanics of Power Matrix. The change to Power Matrix is quite involved. First, you are unable to use abilities while holding a Power Matrix. Second, once you pick up a Power Matrix, causes a Matrix Surge to chase after the holder of the Power Matrix which will kill anyone if they are hit by it. The third change is you need to dunk two Power Matrix's into the Reorigination Drive within 3 seconds of each other. This means as a raid you will need to dedicate multiple players to dunking both sides of Power Matrix's at the same time. The easiest way to go about this is to have a total of four warlocks use Demonic Gateways (2 on each side) to deliver the Power Matrix's to the Reorigination Drive as fast as possible without needing to clear the Amorphous Cysts that are on the upper level. There is one last change to orb running which involves the Amorphous Cysts new ability, Tendrils of Corruption. Tendrils of Corruption move between the Amorphous Cysts that root any player that touches them. If you move along the upper level with an emphasis on staying towards the arena, you should never be in the path of the Tendrils of Corruption. On the arena floor, you will notice a few changes, the first of which resembles the Infested mythic+ affix.

If you are not familiar with this encounter, check out our heroic guide by clicking the button below. Heroic Guide Mythrax has one substantial change in each of his phases on mythic difficulty which is the addition of his little squid monster Xalzaix. In phase 1, Xalzaix joins the fight every minute. While above 50% health, it casts Void Echoes and Obliteration Blast in a cyclic pattern. Every successful cast of Void Echoes increases the damage of Void Echoes by 50% until Xalzaix is brought below 50% health which causes him to retreat back to Mythrax. In the intermission phases Mythrax retreats to his starting position rather than the center of the room. This is because Xalzaix flies to one of the other three corners. Mythrax then aims his Obliteration Beam at Xalzaix who redirects the beam to a random non-tank player. Bait this by stacking all your ranged players together and move between two points every time a beam is cast. Due to the spread nature of the fight, Wellspring has diminished effectiveness, so High Tide is the go to talent. For tier 90 talents, your only options are Flash Flood and CBT. If you take CBT, time it so you have no chance of healing Mythrax if you were to get mind controlled by an Oblivion Sphere with the explosion of CBT. The last option for talent swaps from this setup is Echo over ES. ES is strong on this fight due to generally needing one healer to be with the second tank away from the group during intermissions. Shamans are great at this job due to having Wind Shear and ES helps your lack of&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/mythrax-mythic/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2018-10-05T18:05" class="feed__date">October 5, 2018</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/zul-mythic/" class="invert">Zul Mythic</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>This guide will assume you are familiar with the Heroic version of the fight and expand on how the fight changes in Mythic difficulty. If you are not familiar with this encounter, check out our heroic guide by clicking the button below. Heroic Guide Like many other fights in Uldir, there are very few changes to Zul on mythic that impact healers. The only one that really matters is the Pool of Darkness applying stacks of Corrupted Blood. This means you will need to add a little more priority healing to people who are soaking Pool of Darkness. As a shaman you may need to purge Decaying Flesh off an add to force it onto another add to permanently kill an add. The jump order for Decaying Flesh is always Crawg to Bloodhexer to Crusher. The second phase of Zul is the only healing intensive phase so look to take the standard AoE healing talents. You could take NG over GS if you aren't having to move much in the last phase. Look for any traits that improve AoE healing. Overflowing Shores, Sprouting Spirits, and Swelling Stream are all excellent choices to fulfill the need of AoE healing. Ancestral Resonance has potential on this fight if someone else can use Bloodlust / Heroism on pull so you can get a large mastery buff in the final phase where healing actually matters. Ebb and Flow has potential since the entire raid is stacked in the final phase.Mythic Healing TipsDPS as much as possible in phase 1.Time Wellspring with Dark Revelations in phase 1.Keep Healing Rain down 100% in phase 2.Drop EWT as soon as you enter phase 2 and use it on cooldown.Don't worry too much about mana management since this fight is so short.</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/zul-mythic/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2018-10-05T18:04" class="feed__date">October 5, 2018</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/vectis-mythic/" class="invert">Vectis Mythic</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>This guide will assume you are familiar with the Heroic version of the fight and expand on how the fight changes in Mythic difficulty. If you are not familiar with this encounter, check out our heroic guide by clicking the button below. Heroic Guide Vectis is largely unchanged in mythic when compared to heroic. The boss largely functions the exact same in terms of his cast sequencing as well as the overall flow of the fight. The mythic additions have to deal with Omega Vector and the stacks of Lingering Infection it leaves behind. Firstly, there are now four Omega Vectors on mythic for your raid to bounce around. It is easiest to deal with this by assigning five players to stack on a point for phase 1 for each Omega Vector (total of 4 stack points). Ideally you will want to have everyone keep their stacks of Lingering Infection low due to the new interaction Lingering Infection has with Contagion. When Vectis casts Contagion, any players with 6 or more stacks of LI will trigger Bursting Lesions. This causes the players afflicted to pulse moderate damage to any other players within 5 yards. If any players have 12 stacks of LI when Contagion is cast, an Engorged Parasite will spawn which casts Caustic Bile and Parasitic Discharge. If you somehow get to 25 or more stacks, and Contagion is cast, you will trigger Terminal Eruption which will instantly kill any players at 25 or more stacks and deal large raid wide damage to all other players. The only other change to this fight is the amount of healing needed to remove Immunosuppression which is increased substantially. The talent selection for Vectis is pretty straight forward in terms of you are looking to maximize stacked healing.

If you are not familiar with this encounter, check out our heroic guide by clicking the button below. Heroic Guide On mythic difficulty, Zek'voz does not again any additional mechanics. Instead, several mechanics have several additions as well as both the projections of Yogg-Saron and C'thun being active the entire fight. In addition, the last titan disc activates at 40% instead of 30%. The first change to Zek'voz's abilities is the addition of another Surging Darkness tick. The first safe spot of every Surging Darkness is the middle ring, which is then followed up by either inner or outer, then middle, then inner or outer again. In addition, when Zek'voz summons small adds, both Silithid Warriors and Nerubian Voidweavers spawn at the same time. The projections of Yogg-Saron and C'thun take turns between casting Roiling Deceit and Eye Beam. The first mechanic will always be Roiling Deceit, then Eye Beam. Depending on when you push into the sub 40% phase you can skip one of these mechanics and get back to back of the other mechanic. Upon pushing into the sub 40% phase, Silithid Warriors and Nerubian Voidweavers stop spawning, but the projections of Yogg-Saron and C'thun continue to cast Roiling Deceit and Eye Beam. Lastly, Eye Beam's cast time is reduced to 1.5 seconds. Always pre-spread for Eye Beam to avoid chaining hits. Standard raiding talents are suggested for Zek'voz. Graceful Spirit is great due to the amount of movement required on Surging Darkness casts. Wellspring, Downpour and EWT are all great for dealing with the consecutive bursts of damage on this fight. You can consider taking CBT if you feel that downpour isn't being&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/zekvoz-mythic/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><nav class="wrapper pagination desc"><div class="pagination__item"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/page/9/" class="readmore">Previous</a></div><div class="pagination__item"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/page/7/" class="readmore">Next </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></nav></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Footer Section</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
