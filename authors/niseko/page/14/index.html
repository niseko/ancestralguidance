It has a decent upfront heal and combos well with Chain Heal. High Tide is the default tier 100 talent since Ancestral Guidance is gone and therefore Ascendance loses a lot of value. You will want to take Echo of the Elements in their 30 to combo with Cloudburst Totem in tier 90. Check out the new Battle for Azeroth talent guide for more details. Talent Guide Go for item level. Intellect has doubled to tripled in value with the new stat squish. Crit is still our best secondary stat followed closely by the other three. Don't stress out about stats too much, the correct spell selection on the right person will do so much more to help your performance than trying to min/max stats. There are no percentages to aim for.

Created by Garg and getting updated by Lytheia and niseko. This article will go into detail on how you set it up to include your own logs. Maeveycakes has done a Video on this topic, if you prefer to watch instead. https://youtu.be/QJ9oSWBJ7eo SplashyStats - the Restoration Shaman Spreadsheet Create a copy by clicking the link in the Info Box in the top right. Alternatively use this link. Your own copy of the Spreadsheet gives you access to a lot of different tools, with an Estimation of stat weights based on logs - such as Gear Comparison (with tier-sets and various item effects), trinket estimations, relic values and neck enchant information. All this is based on log information giving you stat weights, and some look at how much you cast stuff (Sea star -&gt; Chain heal and 4t20, 2t21 look at Healing Rain). The data thats already in the Spreadsheet is based off of logs of various mythic kills of the members of Ancestral Guidance, trying to get a healthy balance of different types of Bosses and players. Inserting your own logs will fine-tune this Data or you are able to only use your own Data if you wish by clearing the User Weights before starting. The Data thats most useful are progress kills as they usually involve you trying your best and not cheesing anything - using fights where you actually have something to heal is good as well, since having a lot of downtime can screw with the results. The initial Setup is happening in the Setup Tab. Here you fill in the Orange filled fields based on what you had in the log.

In this article we will address three things: Amanthul's Vision Velen's Future Sight Eonar's Compassion Highfather's Machinations Unstable Arcanocrystal The Deceivers Grand Design Please refer to the Mythic+ dungeon guide for advice on trinkets to use. Keystone Dungeon Guide Please note that these lists can easily change, based on your stats, the current fight or the trinket’s item level. One way of calculating trinket effectiveness is by running your logs through our Splashystats spreadsheet. Splashystats This trinket is lackluster for shaman, as almost all mana issues can be circumvented with better spell selection. This trinket is decent for shaman, about even with a stat stick of equal item level. This trinket is strong for a fresh level 110. It quickly becomes devalued as you gain access to trinkets from Antorus and Tomb. Similar to Unstable Arcanocrystal, but features intellect as opposed to additional secondaries A very powerful trinket due to our great scaling with secondaries. Most of the trinkets for 5 mans are relatively lackluster. Here you’ll find the only real option from 5 man dungeons: By far the best trinket available from 5 man dungeons. It gives about 1 proc, per stat, per minute. As one of the Pantheon Trinkets, it will eventually outpace almost any other option once it hits item level 1000. Its issue is that, at equivalent item level it is not very strong. However, it is definitely worthwhile if using it grants your raid a Pantheon Proc. Overall just a very strong trinket. SImilar to an Arcanocrystal, but even more powerful. Definitely best in slot. A trinket that is very strong in its niche. It aids in spot healing for debuffs, something very prevalent in Antorus&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/trinket-overview/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2017-12-23T13:43" class="feed__date">December 23, 2017</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/varimathras-mythic/" class="invert">Varimathras Mythic</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>PRIMARY MECHANICSVarimathras is pretty straightforward as far as bosses go, with only a few mechanics to look our for over the entirety of the encounter: For Legendaries any combination of Prydaz + Either Velens/Roots/Fire can be used on this encounter depending on your gear (likely the setup that gives you the best itemization will end up performing the best for you here). Fire rarely overheals, and is actually very strong on this fight overall. Its also important to note that the shield from Prydaz is NOT stopped by the healing reduction from Plague/Fissure/Torment of Shadow, so it can very easily save your life in a situation that nothing else can. This fight is all about timing. Make sure you are keeping healing rain down as much as humanly possible. Keep an eye on the shadow strike/mark/plague timers, and try to top off the players taking damage from those abilities right before they get hit and misery is applied. Try to save SLT for the Torment of Shadow at the end of the fight, as SLT + absorbs like clarity of will are the only things that can heal your tanks for the last 20 seconds of the fight before enrage. Also note that ghost wolf negates the slow from Torment of Frost, so utilize that as much as you can to increase your survivability/throughput.</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/varimathras-mythic/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><nav class="wrapper pagination desc"><div class="pagination__item"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/page/15/" class="readmore">Previous</a></div><div class="pagination__item"><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/page/13/" class="readmore">Next </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></nav></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Footer Section</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
