For the the changes in Mythic difficulty, check out our Mythic guide by clicking the button below. Mythic Guide Taloc is a three phase encounter with phase three largely resembling phase one in terms of mechanics. In phases 1 and 3, the main source of raid damage is Cudgel of Gore. Taloc charges the active tank, and smashes his cudgel into the ground. This deals large raid damage that falls off the further you are from the smash. This is where you are going to want to use healing cooldowns. There are two other mechanics that we need to be concerned with as healers. The first of which is called Plasma Discharge. Taloc picks a few raid members and gives them a debuff that causes them to drop pools of Blood Storm - This debuff also does a moderate amount of damage over time. Standing in Blood Storm deals large amounts of damage as well. Be sure to single target heal people with Plasma Discharge as they will likely be running near each other and might get hit by Blood Storm pools. The last mechanic is Sanguine Static. Taloc will pick a random raid member and shoot a few projectiles along the floor in a cone like trajectory. The middle one will always be targeted at the selected raid member, with multiple side projectiles that deal damage on impact with players and cause a knockback. This is easily dodged and should be, but due to how small the room is in phase 1, expect to have to heal people getting hit by this. When phase 2 begins, Taloc will power down taking reduced damage while the elevator falls into a larger room.

These Lesser Chain Heals work exactly as the spell Chain Heal with a 30% reduction on bounces, but are not augmented by High Tide. The frequency of the totem casting Lesser Chain Heal does not scale with Haste. These Lesser Chain Heals do not feed Cloudburst Totem. By stacking multiples of this trait, only the healing of the Lesser Chain Heals is improved. Overflowing Shores &#8211; Improves the radius of Healing Rain by 10% as well as causes an initial burst of healing on up to 6 allies inside Healing Rain upon cast completion. Only the healing scales with multiple traits. Spouting Spirits &#8211; Provides healing 1 second after Spirit Link Totem is dropped as well as a 15% size increase to the totem&#8217;s effect. Stacking multiples of this trait improves the amount healed. Soothing Waters &#8211; Increases the healing of the initial heal of Chain Heal. This does not effect the bounces of Chain Heal at all. Stacking multiple traits adds more healing. Surging Tides &#8211; Adds an absorb shield when casting Riptide on targets below 50% health. This trait only applies to the initial heal of Riptide. Stacking multiples of this trait increases the size of the absorb shield. Turn of the Tide &#8211; Provides a 5% bonus to TW. Also increases healing on HW and HS when a charge of TW is consumed. Stacking multiple traits increases the healing provided when a TW charge is consumed. Ancestral Resonance &#8211; Provides a 10 second duration increase to your Bloodlust/Heroism. Also enables a chance to gain mastery for 15 seconds.</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/azerite-traits/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2018-08-13T21:00" class="feed__date">August 13, 2018</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/battle-for-azeroth-trinkets/" class="invert">Battle for Azeroth Trinkets</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>As of right now most trinkets do not have significant impact on performance.

Conch of Dark Whispers Alch stone Ward Void Stone Insignia Sliver Conch of Dark Whispers Ward Alch stone Revitalizing Voodoo Totem Void Stone Mirror Please note that these lists can easily change, based on your stats, the current fight or the trinket’s item level. This trinket amazing for early progression, being the only trinket that is “guaranteed.” If you are gearing a fresh character, look to pick this up, otherwise ignore this trinket as an end game option. The amount of mana it returns is minor and it also heals people in a chain heal like fashion. One of the best trinkets in the game for Restoration Shamans due to its high intellect proc, flat versatility and 40% extra mana from mana potions. This trinket has a limited potential though since it can only be crafted as high as 415 ilvl. This trinket amazing for early progression, since it is BoE and more than likely someone on your server will have this for sale. It gives very solid stats since it is a stat stick with int and controllable secondary stats. See below for what rotational abilities give what stat. Critical Strike- Healing Wave, Healing Surge, Chain Heal Versatility- Lightning Bolt, Riptide Mastery- Downpour Haste- Healing Rain (each tick), Wellspring (each hit), Unleash Life With static int this trinket provides solid consistent throughput with an active single target ramping heal.

In this article I'm going to explain these mechanics as best as possible. The three spells highlighted are Chain Heal, Wellspring, and Earth Shield. Some of these mechanics are very straight forward while others may still be confusing, such as in the case of Wellspring. When you cast a Chain Heal, the healing of each bounce is calculated in a specific way. First the base spell power coefficient calculates the initial healing of the Chain Heal. From here any modifiers that increase the healing of the entire Chain Heal are multiplied such as versatility and Unleash Life. Next, the bounce heals are calculated. To do so, the initial heal is multiplied by 0.7^x where x is the bounce count (no falloff if High Tide is talented and the buff is present). From here, mastery and critical strikes are applied to the initial heal and all bounces individually. Any other modifiers such as Earth Shield or Deluge are then applied to each individual bounce. This means that even if you have Earth Shield or Deluge talented it is always best to cast Chain Heal on the most injured target since the initial heal of Chain Heal is the strongest in the chain. Since you can only control the initial cast of Chain Heal it is important to understand how properly target select who to Chain Heal to best manipulate the jumps of Chain Heal. Chain Heal is a “super smart” heal meaning it will always prioritize healing the most injured target within bounce range. When calculating the "best route" to heal, Chain Heal heals targets that are missing the most health numerically rather than targets with the lowest percent health. An example of this is if a target is&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/hidden-spell-mechanics/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2018-07-14T20:30" class="feed__date">July 14, 2018</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/changes-from-legion-to-bfa/" class="invert">Changes from Legion to BFA</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>With Battle for Azeroth coming out and Legion behind us I want to talk about the changes to spells as well as the specialization in general as well as what Azerite traits to look out for going into Uldir. Secondary stats retain a similar balance between each other in BFA as they did in Legion. Tertiary stats such as Leech and Avoidance received relative nerfs. This means you won’t be seeing upwards of 13% leech from only wearing 2-3 pieces of leech gear. This makes tertiary stats much weaker and avoidance cap will be much harder to obtain. In BFA our talents have been changed significantly with only tiers 15, 60, and 100 remaining unchanged. For more details about talents in Battle for Azeroth check out our talents guide here. Talents Guide The Heart of Azeroth is a new artifact necklace that we will be collecting Azerite Power to gain an empowered artifact. This necklace scales in item level in proportion to the number of levels you have unlocked. These levels also unlock Azerite Traits on Azerite Gear. Azerite Gear is limited to Helms, Shoulders, and Chest pieces. Each piece for a particular slot will always have the same traits. That means every shaman who obtains Mail of the Champion will have the same traits to choose from. As the item level of Azerite pieces increases, new rows of traits unlock (up to four currently). The outer ring of traits contains one option for each of the specializations of a class as well as one general purpose trait. Some traits can have some overlap that may work in other specializations, although currently most choices are between the relevant specialization of your choice and the general purpose trait.
