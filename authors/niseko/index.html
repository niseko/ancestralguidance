For simplicity I will cover the no dispel strategy as it is what most guilds have opted to use for their first kill. I will post a few notes under the Healing Tips section regarding the dispel strategy. Mythic Il'gynoth is very similar to its heroic version; the fight does not have very many mechanics, but each of the mechanics are important for every player. The most common strategy is to never dispel Cursed Blood so eventually every single player will have Cursed Blood on them. This means that every player will need to be spread out at least 11 yards, which makes it very hard, if not impossible, to use spells like Chain Heal and Healing Rain effectively. This does, however, eliminate the majority of the mind controls from Touch of the Corruptor, which means you only have to deal with the mechanic once. Periodically 3 players will be targetted by Corruptor's Gaze, making them kite around the beam that spawns beneath them, leaving behind a pool of Morass which will silence and deal a good amount of damage if you step in the pools. Each player should try to stay near previous Morass puddles to maximize the amount of space in the room while staying at least 11 yards apart to prevent Cursed Blood from cleaving. When Il'gynoth dies, it will spawn 3 Organs of Corruption which will cast Pumping Blood roughly every 12 seconds - as a shaman you can solo kick one of these OrgansÂ by yourself, and you should do so for at least the first group that spawns so that the majority of your dps can be on one of the Organs. If Pumping Blood finishes&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/ilgynoth/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2020-04-12T00:44" class="feed__date">April 12, 2020</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/carapace-of-nzoth/" class="invert">Carapace of N&#x27;zoth</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>Fight MechanicsThis is a 3 Phase encounter and each phase is pretty unique, so I am going to breakdown each phase on its own. Phase 1: In this phase you'll have access to your on-use cloak as an additional boss button in the fight that will restore all of your Sanity and instantly heal you to full. This phase is similar to its heroic version, however the tentacles that slam the ground spawn in set locations on Mythic, making this phase even more scripted than its heroic version. The first set of tentacles that spawn will have 4 tentacles - 2 of them slam down in the front and 2 of them slam down in the back, separated by a small gap in the center. You still need to kill all of the Horrific Hemorrhages that spawn on them so that they disappear. The second set of tentacles will spawn in a V formation, cutting off your ability to get to the back of the room near Wrathion. To counter this, you can either leave before the tentacles slam down, or use your cloak to teleport to the back of the room. There will also be 2 Gaze of Madness adds each time they spawn, and each needs to be killed quickly to limit the sanity loss and damage that they deal. Generally you want to interrupt each of them at least once as soon as the channel of Breed Madness has begun (not the cast of the spell) to limit sanity drain and damage done. Like heroic, Madness Bomb will periodically fear 3 players, so if you or someone you're close to is affected you can use Tremor Totem to break the fear. Phase 2: At the start of Phase 2 every players sanity will reset for the final&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/carapace-of-nzoth/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2020-04-12T00:44" class="feed__date">April 12, 2020</time></div><h2><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/drestagath/" class="invert">Drest&#x27;agath</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>Fight MechanicsThis fight does not change much from its Heroic difficulty, instead there are just more adds that spawn and failing to keep them under control will eventually cause your raid to wipe. There are 3 types of adds, the Tentacle of Drest'agath, the Eye of Drest'agath, and the Maw of Drest'agath. The Tentacles are generally the most important adds to manage on the fight because they periodically cast Entropic Crash along with the boss which will deal heavy falloff damage to the entire raid. Having too many Tentacles alive at once can easily cause a wipe, so they should generally be the first thing your group tries to kill. The Maws of Drest'agath will periodically cast Acid Splash, which will do AoE damage on a targetted player. The Maws will also apply a healing absorb to players who are close to them, so ranged DPS should primarily focus these adds down while the melee keep the Tentacles under control. The Eyes of Drest'agath will randomly target a player in line of sight and channel Mind Flay on them which does a good amount of damage over time to the player. Because the Eyes can be interrupted, they should be the last of the adds your group should worry about. Each time an add is killed it will trigger its Death Throes ability, causing all similar add types to also trigger their ability at the same time. Generally, this is not too dangerous to worry about, but if you have multiple of one add type alive it is something you should be aware of. The tanks will take turns debuffing the adds with Volatile Seed - this will debuff you if you are within the circle when it expires, so make sure you are giving your tanks room to drop&hellip;</p><a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/drestagath/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><nav class="wrapper pagination desc"><div class="pagination__item"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/authors/niseko/page/2/" class="readmore">Previous</a></div></nav></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Footer Section</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://niseko.github.io/ancestralguidance/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
